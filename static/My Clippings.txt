Finally, I consider surveillance capitalism’s operations as a challenge to the elemental right to the future tense, which accounts for the individual’s ability to imagine, intend, promise, and construct a future. It is an essential condition of free will and, more poignantly, of the inner resources from which we draw the will to will.

If there was anxiety, it reflected the necessity of living up to the requirements of one’s roles. One was expected to suppress any sense of self that spilled over the edges of the given social role, even at considerable psychic cost. Socialization and adaptation were the materials of a psychology and sociology that regarded the nuclear family as the “factory” for the “production of personalities” ready-made for conformity to the social norms of mass society.

What began as a modern migration from traditional lifeways bloomed into a new society of people born to a sense of psychological individuality, with its double-edged birthright of liberation and necessity. We experience both the right and the requirement to choose our own lives. No longer content to be anonymous members of the mass, we feel our entitlement to self- determination, an obvious truth to us that would have been an impossible act of hubris for Sophie and Max. This mentality is an extraordinary achievement of the human spirit, even as it can be a life sentence to uncertainty, anxiety, and stress.

Thirty-five years before Hayek and Friedman’s ascendance, the great historian Karl Polanyi wrote eloquently on the rise of the market economy. Polanyi’s studies led him to conclude that the operations of a self-regulating market are profoundly destructive when allowed to run free of countervailing laws and policies. He described the double movement: “a network of measures and policies… integrated into powerful institutions designed to check the action of the market relative to labor, land, and money. ”26 The double movement, Polanyi argued, supports the market form while tethering it to society: balancing, moderating, and mitigating its destructive excesses.

In Capital in the Twenty-First Century, the French economist Thomas Piketty integrated years of income data to derive a general law of accumulation: the rate of return on capital tends to exceed the rate of economic growth. This tendency, summarized as r > g, is a dynamic that produces ever-more-extreme income divergence and with it a range of antidemocratic social consequences long predicted as harbingers of an eventual crisis of capitalism. In this context, Piketty cites the ways in which financial elites use their outsized earnings to fund a cycle of political capture that protects their interests from political challenge

Under this new regime, the precise moment at which our needs are met is also the precise moment at which our lives are plundered for behavioral data, and all for the sake of others’ gain. The result is a perverse amalgam of empowerment inextricably layered with diminishment. In the absence of a decisive societal response that constrains or outlaws this logic of accumulation, surveillance capitalism appears poised to become the dominant form of capitalism in our time.

Google’s unique auction methods and capabilities earned a great deal of attention, which distracted observers from reflecting on exactly what was being auctioned: derivatives of behavioral surplus. Click- through metrics institutionalized “customer” demand for these prediction products and thus established the central importance of economies of scale in surplus supply operations. Surplus capture would have to become automatic and ubiquitous if the new logic was to succeed, as measured by the successful trading of behavioral futures.

The logic: Google and other surveillance platforms are sometimes described as “two-sided” or “multi-sided” markets, but the mechanisms of surveillance capitalism suggest something different.93 Google had discovered a way to translate its nonmarket interactions with users into surplus raw material for the fabrication of products aimed at genuine market transactions with its real customers: advertisers.94 The translation of behavioral surplus from outside to inside the market finally enabled Google to convert investment into revenue. The corporation thus created out of thin air and at zero marginal cost an asset class of vital raw materials derived from users’ nonmarket online behavior. At first those raw materials were simply “found,” a by-product of users’ search actions. Later those assets were hunted aggressively and procured largely through surveillance.

That critique is a feat of misdirection that would use a pricing mechanism to institutionalize and therefore legitimate the extraction of human behavior for manufacturing and sale.

In historian Karl Polanyi’s 1944 grand narrative of the “great transformation” to a self-regulating market economy, he described the origins of this translation process in three astonishing and crucial mental inventions that he called “commodity fictions.” The first was that human life could be subordinated to market dynamics and reborn as “labor” to be bought and sold. The second was that nature could be translated into the market and reborn as “land” or “real estate.” The third was that exchange could be reborn as “money.” 3 Nearly eighty years earlier, Karl Marx had described the taking of lands and natural resources as the original “big bang” that ignited modern capital formation, calling it “primitive accumulation.

The key point for our story in the age of surveillance capitalism is that the expansion of opportunities for free expression associated with the internet has been an emancipatory force in many vital respects, but this fact must not blind us to another condition: free speech fundamentalism has deflected careful scrutiny of the unprecedented operations that constitute the new market form and account for its spectacular success.

The comparisons between 2012 and 2015 revealed more than twice as many sites with 100 or more cookies and more than three times the number of sites with 150 or more cookies. In 2015 the team found that anyone who simply visited the 100 most popular websites would collect over 6,000 cookies in his or her computer, 83 percent of which were from third parties unrelated to the website that was visited.

Any consideration of the division of learning must resolve these dilemmas expressed in three essential questions. The first question is “Who knows? ” This is a question about the distribution of knowledge and whether one is included or excluded from the opportunity to learn. The second question is “Who decides? ” This is a question about authority: which people, institutions, or processes determine who is included in learning, what they are able to learn, and how they are able to act on their knowledge. What is the legitimate basis of that authority? The third question is “Who decides who decides? ” This is a question about power.

In Britain, university administrators are already talking about a “missing generation” of data scientists. The huge salaries of the tech firms have lured so many professionals that there is no one left to teach the next generation of students. As one scholar described it, “The real problem is these people are not dispersed through society. The intellect and expertise is concentrated in a small number of companies.”

This two-sided equation is a novel arrangement. As we saw in Chapter 1, the Aware Home project developed at Georgia Tech just a year before the invention of surveillance capitalism employed different practices that embodied very different assumptions: (1) that it must be the individual alone who decides what experience is rendered as data, (2) that the purpose of the data is to enrich the individual’s life, and (3) that the individual is the sole arbiter of how the data are shared or put to use.

Nearly two decades later, the Aware Home is barely more than an archeological fragment reminding us of the road not taken toward an empowering digital future and a more-just division of learning in society. Down that road, it is the individual who knows, decides, and decides who decides: an end in herself, not a means to others’ ends. The lesson of the Aware Home is that there can be rendition without surveillance capitalism. However, the lesson of this chapter and the next is that there can be no surveillance capitalism without rendition.

“smart” is a euphemism for rendition: intelligence that is designed to render some tiny corner of lived experience as behavioral data. Each smart object is a kind of marionette; for all its “smartness,” it remains a hapless puppet dancing to the puppet master’s hidden economic imperatives.

We are told that it’s not possible to identify individuals from these large-scale amalgamations. However, with as little as three bits of data easily culled from the public record—birth date, zip code, and sex—reidentification science has demonstrated its ability to de-anonymize meta-data with “disturbing ease.” 33 In a summary of this research, legal scholar Paul Ohm writes that “re-identification makes all our secrets fundamentally easier to discover and reveal.

He counsels that the way to predict the future is to observe what rich people have because that’s also what the middle class and the poor will want. “What do rich people have now?” he asks rhetorically. “Personal assistants.” That the luxuries of one generation or class become the necessities of the next has been fundamental to the evolution of capitalism during the last five hundred years. Historians describe the “consumer boom” that ignited the first industrial revolution in late-eighteenth-century Britain, when, thanks to visionaries like Josiah Wedgewood and the innovations of the early modern factory, families new to the middle class began to buy the china, furniture, and textiles that only the rich had previously enjoyed. This new “propensity to consume” is considered “unprecedented in the depth to which it penetrated the lower reaches of society.…” 3 In 1767 the political economist Nathaniel Forster worried that “fashionable luxury” was spreading “like a contagion,” and he complained of the “perpetual restless ambition in each of the inferior ranks to raise themselves to the level of those immediately above them. ”4

This is the commercial context in which Kaliouby came to feel that it is perfectly reasonable to assert that an “emotion chip” will become the base operational unit of a new “emotion economy.” She speaks to her audiences of a chip embedded in all things everywhere, running constantly in the background, producing an “emotion pulse” each time you check your phone: “I think in the future we’ll assume that every device just knows how to read your emotions.”

Experience is not what is given to me but rather what I make of it. The same experience that I deride may invite your enthusiasm. The self is the inward space of lived experience from which such meanings are created. In that creation I stand on the foundation of personal freedom: the “foundation” because I cannot live without making sense of my experience. No matter how much is taken from me, this inward freedom to create meaning remains my ultimate sanctuary. Jean-Paul Sartre writes that “freedom is nothing but the existence of our will,” and he elaborates: “Actually it is not enough to will; it is necessary to will to will.” 117 This rising up of the will to will is the inner act that secures us as autonomous beings who project choice into the world and exercise the qualities of self-determining moral judgment that are civilization’s necessary and final bulwark. This is the sense behind another of Sartre’s insights: “Without bearings, stirred by a nameless anguish, the words labor.… The voice is born of a risk: either to lose oneself or win the right to speak in the first person.

As the prediction imperative drives deeper into the self, the value of its surplus becomes irresistible, and cornering operations escalate. What happens to the right to speak in the first person from and as my self when the swelling frenzy of institutionalization set into motion by the prediction imperative is trained on cornering my sighs, blinks, and utterances on the way to my very thoughts as a means to others’ ends? It is no longer a matter of surveillance capital wringing surplus from what I search, buy, and browse. Surveillance capital wants more than my body’s coordinates in time and space. Now it violates the inner sanctum as machines and their algorithms decide the meaning of my breath and my eyes, my jaw muscles, the hitch in my voice, and the exclamation points that I offered in innocence and hope. What happens to my will to will myself into the first person when the surrounding market cosmos disguises itself as my mirror, shape-shifting according to what it has decided I feel or felt or will feel: ignoring, goading, chiding, cheering, or punishing me? Surveillance capital cannot keep from wanting all of me as deep and far as it can go. One firm that specializes in “human analytics” and affective computing has this headline for its marketing customers: “Get Closer to the Truth. Understand the ‘Why.’” What happens when they come for my “truth” uninvited and determined to march through my self, taking the bits and pieces that can nourish their machines to reach their objectives? Cornered in my self, there is no escape.

“It’s no longer simply about ubiquitous computing. Now the real aim is ubiquitous intervention, action, and control. The real power is that now you can modify real-time actions in the real world. Connected smart sensors can register and analyze any kind of behavior and then actually figure out how to change it. Real-time analytics translate into real-time action.” The scientists and engineers I interviewed call this new capability “actuation,” and they describe it as the critical though largely undiscussed turning point in the evolution of the apparatus of ubiquity.

The term choice architecture refers to the ways in which situations are already structured to channel attention and shape action. In some cases these architectures are intentionally designed to elicit specific behavior, such as a classroom in which all the seats face the teacher or an online business that requires you to click through many obscure pages in order to opt out of its tracking cookies. The use of this term is another way of saying in behaviorist language that social situations are always already thick with tuning interventions, most of which operate outside our awareness.

We have seen already that democracy threatens surveillance revenues. Facebook’s practices suggest an equally disturbing conclusion: human consciousness itself is a threat to surveillance revenues, as awareness endangers the larger project of behavior modification. Philosophers recognize “self- regulation,” “self-determination,” and “autonomy” as “freedom of will.”

The deletion of uncertainty is celebrated as a victory over human nature: our cunning and our opportunism. All that’s left to matter are the rules that translate reasons into action, the objective measures of behavior, and the degree of conformance between the two. Social trust eventually withers, a kind of vestigial oddity like a third nipple or wisdom teeth: traces of an evolutionary past that no longer appear in operational form because their context and therefore their purpose have vanished.

So let us establish our bearings. Uncertainty is not chaos but rather the necessary habitat of the present tense. We choose the fallibility of shared promises and problem solving over the certain tyranny imposed by a dominant power or plan because this is the price we pay for the freedom to will, which founds our right to the future tense. In the absence of this freedom, the future collapses into an infinite present of mere behavior, in which there can be no subjects and no projects: only objects.

wake early. The day begins before I open my eyes. My mind is in motion. Words and sentences have streamed through my dreams, solving problems on yesterday’s pages. The first work of the day is to retrieve those words that lay open a puzzle. Only then am I ready to awaken my senses. I try to discern each birdcall in the symphony outside our windows: the phoebe, redwing, blue jay, mockingbird, woodpecker, finch, starling, and chickadee. Soaring above all their songs are the cries of geese over the lake. I splash warm water on my face, drink cool water to coax my body into alertness, and commune with our dog in the still-silent house. I make coffee and bring it into my study, where I settle into my desk chair, call up my screen, and begin. I think. I write these words, and I imagine you reading them. I do this every day of every week—as I have for several years—and it is likely that I will continue to do so for one or two years to come. I watch the seasons from the windows above my desk: first green, then red and gold, then white, and then back to green again. When friends come to visit, they peek into my study. There are books and papers stacked on every surface and most of the floor. I know they feel overwhelmed at this sight, and sometimes I sense that they silently pity me for my obligation to this work and how it circumscribes my days. I do not think that they realize how free I am. In fact, I have never felt more free. How is this possible? I made a promise to complete this work. This promise is my flag planted in the future tense. It represents my commitment to construct a future that cannot come into being should I abandon my promise. This future will not exist without my capacity first to imagine its facts and then to will them into being. I am an inchworm moving with determination and purpose across the distance between now and later. Each tiny increment of territory that I traverse is annexed to the known world, as my effort transforms uncertainty into fact. Should I renege on my promise, the world would not collapse. My publisher would survive the abrogation of our contract. You would find many other books to read. I would move on to other projects. My promise, though, is an anchor that girds me against the vagaries of my moods and temptations. It is the product of my will to will and a compass that steers my course toward a desired future that is not yet real. Events may originate in energy sources outside my will and abruptly alter my course in ways that I can neither predict nor control. Indeed, they have already done so. Despite this certain knowledge of uncertainty, I have no doubt that I am free. I can promise to create a future, and I can keep my promise. If the book that I have imagined is to exist in the future, it must be because I will to will it so. I live in an expansive landscape that already includes a future that only I can imagine and intend. In my world, this book I write already exists. In fulfilling my promise, I make it manifest. This act of will is my claim to the future tense.

There are books and papers stacked on every surface and most of the floor. I know they feel overwhelmed at this sight, and sometimes I sense that they silently pity me for my obligation to this work and how it circumscribes my days. I do not think that they realize how free I am. In fact, I have never felt more free. How is this possible? I made a promise to complete this work. This promise is my flag planted in the future tense. It represents my commitment to construct a future that cannot come into being should I abandon my promise. This future will not exist without my capacity first to imagine its facts and then to will them into being. I am an inchworm moving with determination and purpose across the distance between now and later. Each tiny increment of territory that I traverse is annexed to the known world, as my effort transforms uncertainty into fact. Should I renege on my promise, the world would not collapse. My publisher would survive the abrogation of our contract. You would find many other books to read. I would move on to other projects. My promise, though, is an anchor that girds me against the vagaries of my moods and temptations. It is the product of my will to will and a compass that steers my course toward a desired future that is not yet real. Events may originate in energy sources outside my will and abruptly alter my course in ways that I can neither predict nor control. Indeed, they have already done so. Despite this certain knowledge of uncertainty, I have no doubt that I am free. I can promise to create a future, and I can keep my promise. If the book that I have imagined is to exist in the future, it must be because I will to will it so. I live in an expansive landscape that already includes a future that only I can imagine and intend. In my world, this book I write already exists. In fulfilling my promise, I make it manifest. This act of will is my claim to the future tense.

I briefly review the new imperatives here, both as a summary of the ground that we have covered and as prelude to the question How did they get away with it? Surveillance capitalism’s new story begins with behavioral surplus discovered more or less ready-made in the online environment, when it was realized that the “data exhaust” clogging Google’s servers could be combined with its powerful analytic capabilities to produce predictions of user behavior. Those prediction products became the basis for a preternaturally lucrative sales process that ignited new markets in future behavior. Google’s “machine intelligence” improved as the volume of data increased, producing better prediction products. This dynamic established the extraction imperative, which expresses the necessity of economies of scale in surplus accumulation and depends upon automated systems that relentlessly track, hunt, and induce more behavioral surplus. Google imposed the logic of conquest, defining human experience as free for the taking, available to be rendered as data and claimed as surveillance assets. The company learned to employ a range of rhetorical, political, and technological strategies to obfuscate these processes and their implications. The need for scale drove a relentless search for new high-volume supplies of behavioral surplus, producing competitive dynamics aimed at cornering these supplies of raw material and seeking lawless undefended spaces in which to prosecute these unexpected and poorly understood acts of dispossession. All the while, surveillance capitalists stealthily but steadfastly habituated us to their claims. In the process, our access to necessary information and services became hostage to their operations, our means of social participation fused with their interests. Lucrative prediction products depend upon behavioral surplus, and competition drove the supply challenges to a new level, expressed in the prediction imperative. More-powerful prediction products required economies of scope as well as scale, variation as well as volume. This variation occurs along two dimensions. The first is extension across a wide range of activities; the second is the depth of predictive detail within each activity. In this new phase of competitive intensity, surveillance capitalists are forced from the virtual world into the real one. This migration necessitates new machine processes for the rendition of all aspects of human experience into behavioral data. Competition now occurs in the context of a rapidly evolving global architecture of ubiquitous computation and therefore ubiquitous supply opportunities, as prediction products are increasingly expected to approximate certainty and therefore to guarantee behavioral outcomes. In a third phase of competitive intensity, surveillance capitalists discovered the necessity of economies of action based on new methods that go beyond tracking, capturing, analyzing, and predicting behavior in order to intervene in the state of play and actively shape behavior at the source. The result is that the means of production are subordinated to an elaborate new means of behavioral modification, which relies upon a variety of machine processes, techniques, and tactics (tuning, herding, conditioning) to shape individual, group, and population behavior in ways that continuously improve their approximation to guaranteed outcomes. Just as industrial capitalism was driven to the continuous intensification of the means of production, so surveillance capitalists are now locked in a cycle of continuous intensification of the means of behavioral modification. Surveillance capitalists’ interests have shifted from using automated machine processes to know about your behavior to using machine processes to shape your behavior according to their interests. In other words, this decade-and-a-half trajectory has taken us from automating information flows about you to automating you. Given the conditions of increasing ubiquity, it has become difficult if not impossible to escape this audacious, implacable web. In order to reestablish our bearings, I have asked for a rebirth of astonishment and outrage. Most of all, I have asked that we reject the Faustian pact of participation for dispossession that requires our submission to the means of behavioral modification built on the foundation of the Google declarations.

Under surveillance capitalism, the “means of production” serves the “means of behavioral modification.” Machine processes replace human relationships so that certainty can replace trust. This new assembly relies upon a vast digital apparatus, world-historic concentrations of advanced computational knowledge and skill, and immense wealth. The arc of behavioral modification at scale integrates the many operations that we have examined: ubiquitous extraction and rendition, actuation (tuning, herding, conditioning), behavioral surplus supply chains, machine-intelligence–based manufacturing processes, fabrication of prediction products, dynamic behavioral futures markets, and “targeting,” which leads to fresh rounds of tuning, herding, conditioning, and the coercions of the uncontract, thus renewing the cycle.

When scholars, civil society leaders, journalists, public figures, and, indeed, most of us speak out courageously against this new power, invariably we look to Orwell’s Big Brother and more generally the specter of totalitarianism as the lens through which to interpret today’s threats. Google, Facebook, and the larger field of commercial surveillance are frequently depicted as “digital totalitarianism. ”1 I admire those who have stood against the incursions of commercial surveillance, but I also suggest that the equation of instrumentarian power with totalitarianism impedes our understanding as well as our ability to resist, neutralize, and ultimately vanquish its potency. There is no historical precedent for instrumentarianism, but there is vivid precedent for this kind of encounter with an unprecedented new species of power.

Skinner argues that knowledge does not make us free but rather releases us from the illusion of freedom. In reality, he writes, freedom and ignorance are synonyms. The acquisition of knowledge is heroic in that it rescues us from ignorance, but it is also tragic because it necessarily reveals the impossibility of freedom. For Meyer and for Skinner, our attachments to notions such as freedom, will, autonomy, purpose, and agency are defense mechanisms that protect us from the uncomfortable facts of human ignorance.

In Meyer’s thinking, the shift in perspective from “the human being as a soul” to “the human being as an organism” explained “why the trend of history is in the direction of democracy.” As science overtakes civilization, Meyer assumed a new global recognition of equality and democratic fellowship rooted in the basic fact of our overwhelming similarity as fellow organisms.

There is a fork in the road. In one direction lies the possibility of a synthetic declaration for a third modernity based on the strengthening of democratic institutions and the creative construction of a double movement for our time. On this road we harness the digital to forms of information capitalism that reunite supply and demand in ways that are both genuinely productive of effective life and compatible with a flourishing democratic social order. The first step down this road begins with naming, establishing our bearings, reawakening our astonishment, and sharing a sense of righteous indignity.

This option is Skinner’s version of a behaviorist society that provides a way in which “political action is to be avoided.” In Walden Two a “plan” replaces politics, overseen by a “noncompetitive” group of “Planners” who eschew power in favor of the dispassionate administration of the schedules of reinforcement aimed at the greater good.

Nothing summarizes young life in the hive better than the insights of Facebook’s own North American marketing director, Michelle Klein, who told an audience in 2016 that while the average adult checks his or her phone 30 times a day, the average millennial, she enthusiastically reported, checks more than 157 times daily. Generation Z, we now know, exceeds this pace. Klein described Facebook’s engineering feat: “a sensory experience of communication that helps us connect to others, without having to look away, ” noting with satisfaction that this condition is a boon to marketers. She underscored the design characteristics that produce this mesmerizing effect: design is narrative, engrossing, immediate, expressive, immersive, adaptive, and dynamic.11 If you are over the age of thirty, you know that Klein is not describing your adolescence, or that of your parents, and certainly not that of your grandparents. Adolescence and emerging adulthood in the hive are a human first, meticulously crafted by the science of behavioral engineering; institutionalized in the vast and complex architectures of computer-mediated means of behavior modification; overseen by Big Other; directed toward economies of scale, scope, and action in the capture of behavioral surplus; and funded by the surveillance capital that accrues from unprecedented concentrations of knowledge and power. Our children endeavor to come of age in a hive that is owned and operated by the applied utopianists of surveillance capitalism and is continuously monitored and shaped by the gathering force of instrumentarian power. Is this the life that we want for the most open, pliable, eager, self-conscious, and promising members of our society?

What are the consequences of the failure to win a healthy balance between inner and outer, self and relationship? Clinical studies identify specific patterns associated with this developmental stagnation. Not surprisingly, these include an inability to tolerate solitude, the feeling of being merged with others, an unstable sense of self, and even an excessive need to control others as a way of keeping the mirror close.

Many hopes today are pinned on the new body of EU regulation known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became enforceable in May 2018. The EU approach fundamentally differs from that of the US in that companies must justify their data activities within the GDPR’s regulatory framework. The regulations introduce several key new substantive and procedural features, including a requirement to notify people when personal data is breached, a high threshold for the definition of “consent” that puts limits on a company’s reliance on this tactic to approve personal data use, a prohibition on making personal information public by default, a requirement to use privacy by design when building systems, a right to erasure of data, and expanded protections against decision making authored by automated systems that imposes “consequential” effects on a person’s life. 14 The new regulatory framework also imposes substantial fines for violations, which will rise to a possible 4 percent of a company’s global revenue, and it allows for class-action lawsuits in which users can combine to assert their rights to privacy and data protection

Total information tends toward certainty and the promise of guaranteed outcomes. These operations mean that the supply and demand of behavioral futures markets are rendered in infinite detail. Surveillance capitalism thus replaces mystery with certainty as it substitutes rendition, behavioral modification, and prediction for the old “unsurveyable pattern.” This is a fundamental reversal of the classic ideal of the “market” as intrinsically unknowable.

“Gentlemen, I’ve done many deals in my lifetime and through that process, I’ve developed a methodology, a way of doing things, a philosophy if you will. Within that philosophy, I have certain beliefs. I believe in artificial deadlines. I believe in playing one against the other. I believe in doing everything and anything short of illegal or immoral to get the damned deal done.” Michael had a way of making things extremely clear. We thanked him and headed to the airport. We called both EDS and IBM to let them know that we would complete the process over the next eight weeks and sell the Loudcloud business to someone. If they wanted to play, they had to move on that schedule or withdraw immediately. The Michael Ovitz artificial deadline was in full effect. We knew that we might have to go past it, but Michael gave us confidence that going past the deadline was a better move than not having one.

An early lesson I learned in my career was that whenever a large organization attempts to do anything, it always comes down to a single person who can delay the entire project. An engineer might get stuck waiting for a decision or a manager may think she doesn’t have authority to make a critical purchase. These small, seemingly minor hesitations can cause fatal delays.

It turns out that is exactly what product strategy is all about—figuring out the right product is the innovator’s job, not the customer’s job. The customer only knows what she thinks she wants based on her experience with the current product. The innovator can take into account everything that’s possible, but often must go against what she knows to be true. As a result, innovation requires a combination of knowledge, skill, and courage. Sometimes only the founder has the courage to ignore the data; we were running out of time, so I had to step in: “I don’t care about any of the existing requirements; I need you to reinvent the product and we need to win.”

In my weekly staff meeting, I inserted an agenda item titled “What Are We Not Doing?” Ordinarily in a staff meeting, you spend lots of time reviewing, evaluating, and improving all of the things that you do: build products, sell products, support customers, hire employees, and the like. Sometimes, however, the things you’re not doing are the things you should actually be focused on.

After confirming that acquiring would be superior to building, we negotiated a deal to buy Rendition Networks for $33 million. Within three months of completing the acquisition, John negotiated a deal with Cisco Systems—the world’s largest networking company—to resell our product. The deal included an agreement to prepay us $30 million for advanced licenses. As a result, the Cisco deal alone paid more than 90 percent of the acquisition costs. Note to self: It’s a good idea to ask, “What am I not doing?”

Well-structured goals and objectives contribute to the context, but they do not provide the whole story. More to the point, they are not the story. The story of the company goes beyond quarterly or annual goals and gets to the hard-core question of why. Why should I join this company? Why should I be excited to work here? Why should I buy its product? Why should I invest in the company? Why is the world better off as a result of this company’s existence?

These stories illustrate a simple truth: information is power. Anyone who holds a vast amount of information about us has power over us. At first, the information age promised to empower individuals with access to previously hidden information. We could comparison shop across the world for the best price, for the best bit of knowledge, for people who shared our views. But now the balance of power is shifting and large institutions—both governments and corporations—are gaining the upper hand in the information wars, by tracking vast quantities of information about mundane aspects of our lives.

In my quest to understand the history and origins of mass surveillance, I kept returning to the year 2001. Not only was it the year of the devastating terrorist attacks on the United States, but it was also the year that the technology industry was left reeling from the bursting of the dot-com bubble. These two seemingly unrelated events each set in motion a chain of events that created the legal and technical underpinnings of today’s dragnets. For the U.S. government, the terrorist attacks showed that its traditional methods of intelligence gathering weren’t working. And for Silicon Valley, the crash showed that it needed to find a new way to make money. Both arrived at the same answer to their disparate problems: collecting and analyzing vast quantities of personal data.

Jeffrey Goldberg, a password expert at AgileBits, the makers of 1Password, told me that entropy is a measure of “how many ways you could get a different result using the same system.” Short, simple passwords, such as dictionary words, have very low entropy because they can easily be guessed.

Known as “muckrakers,” investigative journalists such as Ida Tarbell and Upton Sinclair exposed the underbelly of the industrial revolution, from monopolistic price gouging by the trusts to working conditions in slaughterhouses. Their work led to laws that reined in the worst excesses of the era. I believe that today we are at a similar turning point. As our nation shifts toward an information economy, there are few laws policing the booming industry giants and few governmental or nonprofit institutions with the technical savvy to police the information economy. And so it falls to today’s muckrakers—investigative journalists and conscientious objectors like Edward Snowden—to reveal the underbelly of the information revolution. I hope that once we see the abuses clearly, we will be able to find a way to restrain the excesses of the information age.

So, in my mind, some lies are acceptable. But which ones? I found myself attracted to the “publicity test” described by the Harvard writer and philosopher Sissela Bok: “Which lies, if any, would survive the appeal for justification to reasonable persons?” Some of the questions she asks: • Are there truthful alternatives to your lie? • What is the moral justification for telling the lie? • What is the relationship that exists between you and the person you are lying to? • What goods and bads will be brought about by your lie? • What would happen if everyone in your situation lied?

Only some debts can be settled with money. Those debts have certain characteristics, he says. They are debts between “potential equals” but “who are not currently in a state of equality” who use money to set matters straight. “Debt … is just an exchange that has not been brought to completion,” he writes.

But the truth is that location is one of the most revealing pieces of data about a person. In 2013, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Université catholique de Louvain in Belgium studied fifteen months of location data for 1.5 million people. They found that four instances of a person’s location at a given point in time were enough to uniquely identify 95 percent of the individuals in the study. “Human mobility traces are highly unique,” the researchers wrote. “Mobility data is among the most sensitive data currently being collected.” Location is also predictive. Researchers at Microsoft found that location data can be used to predict fairly accurately where people will be located in the future. Using data from more than three hundred volunteers, they found that they could predict where people would be located in the future. Wednesdays were the easiest to predict, and weekends the hardest. “While your location in the distant future is in general highly independent of your recent location,” the researchers wrote, “it is likely to be a good predictor of your location exactly one week from now.”

He points to a Stanford University study showing that an individual will respond more positively to a politician whose picture is subtly blended with his or her own photo. The change in the photo is undetectable, but it makes the viewer more receptive to the politician’s message. “It turns out we like people more who look like us,” Calo concluded. “Now imagine if a social network were to offer a comparable service, permitting advertisers to blend their spokesperson with the user’s own profile picture.” Calo doesn’t know of anyone using this technique.

It’s a particularly poignant question now that I understand the psychological effects of surveillance. Research shows that covert surveillance can cause anxiety and self-repression in adults. In children, surveillance appears to do something particularly depressing: it undermines their enthusiasm to learn. A landmark 1975 study concluded that adult surveillance of children had the effect of “turning play into work,” dampening the children’s enthusiasm for playing with an interesting puzzle. In the study, children were left alone in a room with a camera pointed at them and told that an adult would be watching them through the camera as they played with the puzzle. The next time the surveilled children were presented with the puzzle in a normal classroom setting, they had far less interest in playing with it than the control group. “The knowledge that one’s performance at a task is being observed and evaluated by someone else … appears sufficient to decrease later interest in the task,” wrote the study’s authors, Mark R. Lepper and David Greene.

Children were shown enticing toys and told that they could play with them if they did a good job on the puzzles. The next time that they were presented with the puzzle in a normal classroom setting, their interest in the puzzle fell even further. Lepper and Greene concluded that the best way to interest children in an activity is to “employ the minimal amount of pressure sufficient to elicit or maintain the desired behavior.”

Another possible way to make dragnet operators more accountable for their actions is simply to charge them for access to our personal data. This idea is seductive in its simplicity. I would reclaim my personal data, store it in a virtual locker, and sell some of it on the open market—rather than having it “taken” from me. A few start-ups have popped up in the hopes of privatizing the personal data market. And in 2011, the World Economic Forum declared that personal data was emerging as a “New Asset Class.” But so far, personal data are an underperforming asset. The reason is simple supply and demand: I don’t have the only copy of my data, since there is no law requiring data brokers to give it back to me. Therefore, no one is going to pay me much to use my copy of the data when they can get it somewhere else cheaper. An analysis by the Financial Times found that the ubiquity of personal data has driven prices down so that an average person’s age, gender, and location is worth only a fraction of a cent. And the sum total of information about most people sells for less than a dollar. I entered my information into the Financial Times’s data calculator and found that my information was worth only 28 cents. Laws that give people ownership—or partial ownership—of their data might help boost the price for data. But it would also get complicated really fast. After all, how do I share ownership of my phone calling data with AT&T? And how do I prevent the government from taking my partially owned data from AT&T? And I’m not sure that selling data would end up limiting the chilling effects of surveillance. Before we had a minimum wage and limited work hours, people were willing to “sell” their labor at extremely low prices for very long hours.

Carnegie Mellon professor Alessandro Acquisti, who studies the economics of privacy, has found that people are less willing to pay for privacy when they don’t already have it. In one experiment, Acquisti and his fellow researchers offered one group of people a free $10 Visa gift card and told them their spending would be anonymous. They offered another group a $12 gift card and told them that their spending would be identified. Then they offered members of each group the opportunity to trade their card for the other group’s card. Fifty-two percent of the $10 cardholders kept their card—in effect agreeing to pay $2 to keep their privacy. But over 90 percent of the $12 cardholders refused to trade—meaning that they refused to give up $2 to protect their privacy. “What this tells us is that people value some things more when they have them than when they do not have them,” Acquisti told me. In essence, when you don’t have privacy, you feel less pain from losing it. Instead, you feel the pain of having to “buy back” privacy. This inability to accurately assign value to our data is one reason that most products that are sold to protect privacy fail. And it’s one reason that turning personal data into a currency—without any enabling legislation to make personal data scarce, and thus more valuable—could just enable and legitimize ubiquitous surveillance.

The publicity test is also reminiscent of one of the most effective tactics of the environmental movement. Every year, the Environmental Protection Agency publishes a list of the companies that store the most toxic pollutants in its Toxics Release Inventory. The publicity of the list caused companies to compete to hold fewer toxins, which then resulted in fewer spills. “Everybody wants to avoid being high on that list,” said Lisa Heinzerling, a Georgetown University environmental law professor. “That’s been a big success story.”

The problem is that tappers have been given knowledge (the song title) that makes it impossible for them to imagine what it’s like to lack that knowledge.

Contrast the “maximize shareholder value” idea with John F. Kennedy’s famous 1961 call to “put a man on the moon and return him safely by the end of the decade.” Simple? Yes. Unexpected? Yes. Concrete? Amazingly so. Credible? The goal seemed like science fiction, but the source was credible. Emotional? Yes. Story? In miniature. Had John F. Kennedy been a CEO, he would have said, “Our mission is to become the international leader in the space industry through maximum team-centered innovation and strategically targeted aerospace initiatives.” Fortunately, JFK was more intuitive than a modern-day CEO; he knew that opaque, abstract missions don’t captivate and inspire people. The moon mission was a classic case of a communicator’s dodging the Curse of Knowledge. It was a brilliant and beautiful idea—a single idea that motivated the actions of millions of people for a decade.

According to one account, perhaps apocryphal, the inverted pyramid arose during the Civil War. All the reporters wanted to use military telegraphs to transmit their stories back home, but they could be cut off at any moment; they might be bumped by military personnel, or the communication line might be lost completely—a common occurrence during battles. The reporters never knew how much time they would get to send a story, so they had to send the most important information first.

Hawkins fought feature creep by carrying around a wooden block the size of the Palm. Trae Vassallo, a member of the Palm V design team, says, “The block was dumb, which resonated with the simple technological goals of the product, but it was also small, which made the product elegant and different.” Hawkins would pull out the wooden block to “take notes” during a meeting or “check his calendar” in the hallway. Whenever someone suggested another feature, Hawkins would pull out the wooden block and ask them where it would fit. Vassallo said that the Palm Pilot became a successful product “almost because it was defined more in terms of what it was not than in terms of what it was.” Tom Kelley, from IDEO, a prominent Silicon Valley design firm, made a similar point: “The real barrier to the initial PDAs … was the idea that the machine had to do nearly everything.”

Here’s where we’re going: We’ve seen that compact ideas are stickier, but that compact ideas alone aren’t valuable—only ideas with profound compactness are valuable. So, to make a profound idea compact you’ve got to pack a lot of meaning into a little bit of messaging. And how do you do that? You use flags. You tap the existing memory terrain of your audience. You use what’s already there.

Having them think of their role as performance, rather than maintenance, is a key part of the park’s success. “Employees as cast members” is a generative metaphor that has worked for Disney for more than fifty years. Contrast Disney with Subway. Like Disney, Subway has created a metaphor for its frontline employees. They are “sandwich artists.” This metaphor is the evil twin of Disney’s “cast members.” It is utterly useless as a guide to how the employee should act. Disney expects its cast members to behave like actors, but Subway does not expect its counter help to behave like artists.

So, a good process for making your ideas stickier is: (1) Identify the central message you need to communicate—find the core; (2) Figure out what is counterintuitive about the message—i.e., What are the unexpected implications of your core message? Why isn’t it already happening naturally? (3) Communicate your message in a way that breaks your audience’s guessing machines along the critical, counterintuitive dimension.

its managers set a goal that was deliberately concrete: The 727 must seat 131 passengers, fly nonstop from Miami to New York City, and land on Runway 4-22 at La Guardia. (The 4-22 runway was chosen for its length—less than a mile, which was much too short for any of the existing passenger jets.) With a goal this concrete, Boeing effectively coordinated the actions of thousands of experts in various aspects of engineering or manufacturing. Imagine how much harder it would have been to build a 727 whose goal was to be “the best passenger plane in the world.”

Stephen Covey, in his book The 8th Habit, describes a poll of 23,000 employees drawn from a number of companies and industries. He reports the poll’s findings: Only 37 percent said they have a clear understanding of what their organization is trying to achieve and why. Only one in five was enthusiastic about their team’s and their organization’s goals. Only one in five said they had a clear “line of sight” between their tasks and their team’s and organization’s goals. Only 15 percent felt that their organization fully enables them to execute key goals. Only 20 percent fully trusted the organization they work for. Pretty sobering stuff. It’s also pretty abstract. You probably walk away from these stats thinking something like “There’s a lot of dissatisfaction and confusion in most companies.” Then Covey superimposes a very human metaphor over the statistics. He says, “If, say, a soccer team had these same scores, only 4 of the 11 players on the field would know which goal is theirs. Only 2 of the 11 would care. Only 2 of the 11 would know what position they play and know exactly what they are supposed to do. And all but 2 players would, in some way, be competing against their own team members rather than the opponent.” The soccer analogy generates a human context for the statistics. It creates a sense of drama and a sense of movement. We can’t help but imagine the actions of the two players trying to score a goal, being opposed at every stage by the rest of their team. Why does the analogy work? It relies on our schema of soccer teams and the fact that this schema is somehow cleaner, more well-defined, than our schemas of organizations. It’s more vivid to think of a lack of cooperation on a soccer team—where teamwork is paramount—than in a corporation. And this is exactly Covey’s point: Corporations should operate like teams, but they don’t. Humanizing the statistics gives the argument greater wallop.

So why do people predict badly? Because of the availability bias. The availability bias is a natural tendency that causes us, when estimating the probability of a particular event, to judge the event’s probability by its availability in our memory. We intuitively think that events are more likely when they are easier to remember. But often the things we remember are not an accurate summary of the world.

Floyd Lee, the manager of the Pegasus dining hall, has it right. He could have generated motivation through a strict self-interest appeal: perhaps by offering to let his employees off ten minutes early every night if they worked hard, or by giving them the first choice of the steaks. Instead, he helped create a kind of Pegasus identity: A Pegasus chef is in charge of morale, not food. You can imagine hundreds of decisions being made by staffers in the tent who think to themselves, What should a Pegasus person do in this situation?

Ingersoll-Rand is a giant company that makes nonsexy products such as industrial grinders, used in auto shops to sand down auto bodies. Historically, Ingersoll-Rand had been slow at bringing new products to market. One employee, frustrated by the average four-year product life cycle, said, “It was taking us longer to introduce a new product than it took our nation to fight World War II.” Ingersoll-Rand decided to do something about the slow development cycle. The company created a project team whose goal was to produce a new grinder in a year—one quarter the usual time. Standard theories of organizational culture would have predicted a slim chance of success. The grinder team, however, did a lot of things right, including the use of stories to emphasize the group’s new attitude and culture. One story, for instance, involved a critical decision about whether to build the new grinder’s casing out of plastic or metal. Plastic would be more comfortable for the customer, but would it hold up as well as metal? The traditional Ingersoll-Rand method of solving this problem would have been to conduct protracted, careful studies of the tensile and compression properties of both materials. But this was the Grinder Team. They were supposed to act quickly. A few members of the team cooked up a less formal testing procedure. While on an off-site customer visit, the team members tied a sample of each material to the back bumper of their rental car, then drove around the parking lot with the materials dragging behind. They kept this up until the police came and told them to knock it off. The verdict was that the new plastic composite held up just as well as the traditional metal. Decision made. In the history of the Grinder Team, this story has become known as the Drag Test. The Drag Test is a Creativity plot that reinforced the team’s new culture. The Drag Test implied, “We still need to get the right data to make decisions. We just need to do it a lot quicker.”

The students divide into small groups and each one gives a one-minute speech while the others listen. After each speech, the listeners rate the speaker: How impressive was the delivery? How persuasive? What happens, invariably, is that the most polished speakers get the highest ratings. Students who are poised, smooth, and charismatic are rated at the top of the class. No surprise, right? Good speakers score well in speaking contests. The surprise comes next. The exercise appears to be over; in fact, Chip often plays a brief Monty Python clip to kill a few minutes and distract the students. Then, abruptly, he asks them to pull out a sheet of paper and write down, for each speaker they heard, every single idea that they remember. The students are flabbergasted at how little they remember. Keep in mind that only ten minutes have elapsed since the speeches were given. Nor was there a huge volume of information to begin with—at most, they’ve heard eight one-minute speeches. And yet the students are lucky to recall one or two ideas from each speaker’s presentation. Many draw a complete blank on some speeches—unable to remember a single concept.

Edison was not a lone inventor; he created the first industrial R&D lab in Menlo Park, New Jersey. The researchers in his labs were called “muckers.” The term comes from two slang phrases of the time—“to muck in” was to work together as mates, and “to muck around” was to fool around. Why was this a good way for Edison’s researchers to talk strategy?

How do you choose in the myriad daily situations where the conflict will arise? (E.g., “Is it okay to spend the next hour of my time fooling around in the lab?”) The term “muckers” is a strategy statement masquerading as a nickname. It makes it clear that, given the tough choice between efficiency and experimentation, you choose experimentation. Why? Because you’re a mucker. Muckers don’t obsess over Gantt charts. Muckers muck. And muckers muck because that is precisely the organizational capability that will make Menlo Park successful. Talking strategy in a thoughtful way can relieve the burden of decision paralysis.

If everyone in your organization has the same understanding of its strategy, people can disagree constructively. As an analogy, if you’re playing darts and your friend consistently aims too high, you can give useful feedback. But it’s the obvious location of the bull’s-eye that makes your comment possible. What if you and your friend don’t agree on where it is? In that case, your communication will be unproductive and irritating for both of you—and if you were playing “business” rather than darts, the person with more power would win the discussion. A common strategic language allows everyone to contribute.

Business success contains the seeds of its own destruction. The more successful you are, the more people want a chunk of your business and then another chunk and then another until there is nothing left. I believe that the prime responsibility of a manager is to guard constantly against other people’s attacks and to inculcate this guardian attitude in the people under his or her management.

Are such developments a constructive or a destructive force? In my view, they are both. And they are inevitable. In technology, whatever can be done will be done. We can’t stop these changes. We can’t hide from them. Instead, we must focus on getting ready for them.

Businesses are about creating change for other businesses. Competition is about creating change; technology is about creating change. The appearance and disappearance of regulations cause further changes. Sometimes these changes affect only a company, other times they affect an entire industry. So the ability to recognize that the winds have shifted and to take appropriate action before you wreck your boat is crucial to the future of an enterprise.

Generations of business people and business students have been trained to think in terms of these forces, so I’ll adopt them as our starting point. Porter describes five forces that determine the competitive well-being of a business. In my paraphrasing, they are: • The power, vigor and competence of a company’s existing competitors: Are there a lot of them? Are they well funded? Do they clearly focus on your business? • The power, vigor and competence of a company’s suppliers: Are there a lot of them, so that the business has plenty of choices, or are there few of them, so that they have the business by the throat? Are they aggressive and greedy or are they conservative and guided by the long view toward their customers? • The power, vigor and competence of a company’s customers: Are there a lot of them or is the business dependent on just one or two major customers? Are the customers very demanding, perhaps because their business operates under cutthroat competition, or is their business more “gentlemanly”? • The power, vigor and competence of a company’s potential competitors: These players are not in the business today but circumstances could change and they might decide to come in; if so, they may be bigger, more competent, better funded and more aggressive than the existing competitors. • The possibility that your product or service can be built or delivered in a different way. This is often called “substitution,” and I’ve found that this last factor is the most deadly of all. New techniques, new approaches, new technologies can upset the old order, mandate a new set of rules and create an entirely new climate in which to do business.

Recent modifications of competitive theory call attention to a sixth force: the force of complementors. Complementors are other businesses from whom customers buy complementary products. Each company’s product works better or sometimes only works with the other company’s product. Cars need gasoline; gasoline needs cars. Computers need software; software needs computers. Complementors often have the same interests as your business and travel the same road. I think of them as “fellow travelers.” While your interests are aligned, your products support each other. However, new techniques, new approaches, new technologies can upset the old order and change the relative influence of the complementors or cause the path of fellow travelers to diverge from yours.

Horizontal industries live and die by mass production and mass marketing. They have their own rules. The companies that have done well in the brutally competitive horizontal computer industry have learned these implicit rules. By following them, a company has the opportunity to compete and prosper. By defying them, no matter how good its products are, no matter how well they execute their plans, a company is slogging uphill. What are these rules? There are three. One, don’t differentiate without a difference. Don’t introduce improvements whose only purpose is to give you an advantage over your competitor without giving your customer a substantial advantage. The personal computer industry is characterized by well-chronicled failures when manufacturers, ostensibly motivated by a desire to make “a better PC,” departed from the mainstream standard. But goodness in a PC was inseparable from compatibility, so “a better PC” that was different turned out to be a technological oxymoron. Two, in this hypercompetitive horizontal world, opportunity knocks when a technology break or other fundamental change comes your way. Grab it. The first mover and only the first mover, the company that acts while the others dither, has a true opportunity to gain time over its competitors—and time advantage, in this business, is the surest way to gain market share. Conversely, people who try to fight the wave of a new technology lose in spite of their best efforts because they waste valuable time. Three, price for what the market will bear, price for volume, then work like the devil on your costs so that you can make money at that price. This will lead you to achieve economies of scale in which the large investments that are necessary can be effective and productive and will make sense because, by being a large-volume supplier, you can spread and recoup those costs. By contrast, cost-based pricing will often lead you into a niche position, which in a mass-production-based industry is not very lucrative. I think these rules are pretty general for horizontally based industries.

It was as if Steve Jobs and his company had gone into a time capsule when they started Next. They worked hard for years, competing against what they thought was the competition, but by the time they emerged, the competition turned out to be something completely different and much more powerful. Although they were oblivious to it, Next found itself in the midst of a strategic inflection point. The Next machine never took off.

The table provides a snapshot of what the examples in this chapter illustrate. As I scan it, I can’t help but be impressed by the variety and pervasiveness of strategic inflection points. Note that everywhere there are winners and losers. And note also that, to a large extent, whether a company became a winner or a loser was related to its degree of adaptability. Strategic inflection points offer promises as well as threats. It is at such times of fundamental change that the cliché “adapt or die” takes on its true meaning.

There is a fine distinction here. When I say, “Learn what goes on at the periphery of your business,” it means something different than if I had said, “Learn what goes on in your business.” In the ordinary course of business, I talk with the general manager, with the sales manager, with the manufacturing manager. I learn from them what goes on in the business. But they will give me a perspective from a position that is not terribly far from my own. When I absorb news or information coming from people who are geographically distant or who are several levels below me in the organization, I will triangulate on business issues with their view, which comes from a completely different perspective.

Management writers use the word “vision” for this. That’s too lofty for my taste. What you’re trying to do is capture the essence of the company and the focus of its business. You are trying to define what the company will be, yet that can only be done if you also undertake to define what the company will not be.

An organization that has a culture that can deal with these two phases—debate (chaos reigns) and a determined march (chaos reined in)—is a powerful, adaptive organization. Such an organization has two attributes: 1. It tolerates and even encourages debate. These debates are vigorous, devoted to exploring issues, indifferent to rank and include individuals of varied backgrounds. 2. It is capable of making and accepting clear decisions, with the entire organization then supporting the decision. Organizations that have these characteristics are far more strategic-inflection-point-ready than others. While the description of such a culture is seductively logical, it’s not a very easy environment in which to operate, particularly if you are a newcomer to it and are not familiar with the subtle transition in the swings of the pendulum.

There's barely a product or service on the market today that customers can't buy from someone else for about the same price, about the same quality, about the same level of service and about the same features. If you truly have a first-mover's advantage, it's probably lost in a matter of months. If you offer something truly novel, someone else will soon come up with something similar and maybe even better. But if you ask most businesses why their customers are their customers, most will tell you it's because of superior quality, features, price or service. In other words, most companies have no clue why their customers are their customers. This is a fascinating realization. If companies don't know why their customers are their customers, odds are good that they don't know why their employees are their employees either. If most companies don't really know why their customers are their customers or why their employees are their employees, then 17 START WITH WHY how do they know how to attract more employees and encourage loyalty among those they already have? The reality is, most businesses today are making decisions based on a set of incomplete or, worse, completely flawed assumptions about what's driving their business. There are only two ways to influence human behavior: you can manipulate it or you can inspire it. When I mention manipulation, this is not necessarily pejorative; it's a very common and fairly be-nign tactic. In fact, many of us have been doing it since we were young. "I'll be your best friend" is the highly effective negotiating tactic employed by generations of children to obtain something they want from a peer. And as any child who has ever handed over candy hoping for a new best friend will tell you, it works.

Once buyers get used to paying a lower-than-average price for a product or service, it is very hard to get them to pay more. And the sellers, facing overwhelming pressure to push prices lower and lower in order to compete, find their margins cut slimmer and slimmer. This only drives a need to sell more to compensate. And the quickest way to do that is price again. And so the downward spiral of price addiction sets in. In the drug world, these addicts are called junkies. In the business world, we call them commodities.

Consider the classic business school case of the railroads. In the late 1800s, the railroads were the biggest companies in the country. Having achieved such monumental success, even changing the landscape of America, remembering WHY stopped being important to them. Instead they became obsessed with WHAT they did— they were in the railroad business. This narrowing of perspective influenced their decision-making—they invested all their money in tracks and crossties and engines. But at the beginning of the twentieth century, a new technology was introduced: the airplane. And all those big railroad companies eventually went out of business. What if they had defined themselves as being in the mass transportation business? Perhaps their behavior would have been different. Perhaps they would have seen opportunities that they otherwise missed. Perhaps they would own all the airlines today.

But when a company clearly communicates their WHY, what they believe, and we believe what they believe, then we will sometimes go to extraordinary lengths to include those products or brands in our lives. This is not because they are better, but because they become markers or symbols of the values and beliefs we hold dear. Those products and brands make us feel like we belong and we feel a kinship with others who buy the same things.

Companies that fail to communicate a sense of WHY force us to make decisions with only empirical evidence. This is why those decisions take more time, feel difficult or leave us uncertain. Under these conditions manipulative strategies that exploit our desires, fears, doubts or fantasies work very well. We're forced to make these less-than-inspiring decisions for one simple reason— companies don't offer us anything else besides the facts and figures, features and benefits upon which to base our decisions. Companies don't tell us WHY.

But Southwest was not built to be an airline. It was built to champion a cause. They just happened to use an airline to do it. In the early 1970s, only 15 percent of the traveling population traveled by air. At that rate, the market was small enough to scare off most would-be competitors to the big airlines. But Southwest wasn't interested in competing against everyone else for 15 percent of the traveling population. Southwest cared about the other 85 percent. Back then, if you asked Southwest whom their competition was, they would have told you, "We compete against the car and the bus." But what they meant was, "We're the champion for the common man."

In the 1970s, air travel was expensive, and if Southwest was going to be the champion for the common man, they had to be cheap. It was an imperative. And in a day and age when air travel was elitist—back then people wore ties on planes—as the champion for the common man, Southwest had to be fun. It was an imperative.

The result of their actions was made tangible in the things they said and did— their product, the people they hired, their culture and their marketing. "You are now free to move about the country," they said in their advertising. That's much more than a tagline. That's a cause. And it's a cause looking for followers. Those who could relate to Southwest, those who saw themselves as average Joes, now had an alternative to the big airlines. And those who believed what Southwest believed became fiercely loyal to the company. They felt Southwest was a company that spoke directly to them and directly for them.

Ron Bruder is not a household name, but he is a great leader. In 1985, he stood at a crosswalk with his two daughters waiting for the light to change so they could cross the street. A perfect opportunity, he thought, to teach the young girls a valuable life lesson. He pointed across the street to the red glow of the "Do Not Walk" signal and asked them what they thought that sign meant. "It means we 163 START WITH WHY have to stand here," they replied. "Are you sure?" he asked rhetorically. "How do you know it's not telling us to run?" Soft-spoken and almost always wearing a well-tailored three- piece suit when he comes to work, Bruder looks like you would imagine a conservative executive to look like. But don't assume you know how things work simply based on what you see. Bruder is anything but a stereotype. Though he has enjoyed the trappings of success, he is not motivated by them. They have always been the unintended by-product of his work. Bruder is driven by a clear sense of WHY. He sees a world in which people accept the lives they live and do the things they do not because they have to, but because no one ever showed them an alternative. This is the lesson he was teaching his daughters that day at the crosswalk—there is always another perspective to be considered. That Bruder always starts with WHY has enabled him to achieve great things for himself. But more significantly, it is his ability to share his WHY through the things he does that inspires those around him to do great things for themselves.

Humans are wired to oversimplify explanations for both good and bad outcomes through what philosophers call the single cause fallacy.

Furthermore, we’re prone to make what psychologists call the fundamental attribution error. Research shows that when we observe others, our explanations for their behaviors tend to overemphasize dispositional factors—their personality type and the values we assume they have—while downplaying situational factors, such as social pressures or environmental circumstances. By contrast, when explaining our own behaviors, we tend to attribute good outcomes to dispositional factors—in particular, our skill and diligence—and bad outcomes to situational ones. This is why we perceive the BMW driver who just cut us off to be a self-centered jerk, while he blames his car’s blind spot. And it’s why, when a new venture falters, investors and team members often blame the founder’s shortcomings—whereas the founder frequently points her finger at external circumstances (“a soft economy”) or other parties (“our VCs, who pushed too hard for growth”). The result is that both first- and third-party explanations for why a startup failed may not be reliable. So rather than accept those explanations at face value, I would need to develop an independent and objective view of the startup’s value proposition, team members’ capabilities, investors’ objectives, founders’ motivations, and so forth. And luckily, my role at HBS gave me access to hundreds of alumni entrepreneurs who trusted me enough to do this.

I concluded that Lean Startup practices were falling short of their promise.

Specifically, they launched minimum viable products (MVPs)—the simplest possible offering that would yield reliable customer feedback—and iterated on them in response. By putting their MVP out there and testing how customers responded, these founders should have been able to avoid squandering too much time and money building and marketing a product that no one wanted.

Yet by neglecting to research customer needs before commencing their engineering efforts, they ended up wasting valuable time and capital on an MVP that was likely to miss its mark. These were False Starts; the entrepreneurs were like sprinters who jumped the gun—too eager to get a product out there. The rhetoric of the Lean Startup movement actually encourages this “ready, fire, aim” behavior.

But entrepreneurs—like all of us—are prone to see what they hope to see. False Positives occur when entrepreneurs, beguiled by the enthusiasm of a few early adopters, incorrectly extrapolate strong demand to the mainstream market and step on the gas.

With a False Start failure, a team builds the wrong product—one that fails to meet customers’ needs—because they skipped up-front research. With a False Positive failure, a team builds a product that meets the needs of the wrong customers: focusing too much on early adopters and not enough on mainstream customers.

Scaling startups typically need senior executives with deep functional expertise who can manage rapidly expanding pools of employees in engineering, marketing, finance, and operations. Delaying the hiring of these executives or recruiting the wrong individuals can lead to strategic drift, spiraling costs, and a dysfunctional culture.

Each pursued an incredibly ambitious vision, and in doing so faced multiple challenges, including most or all of the following: 1) persuading a critical mass of customers to fundamentally change their behavior; 2) mastering new technologies; 3) partnering with powerful corporations who’d prospered from the status quo; 4) securing regulatory relief or other government support; and 5) raising vast amounts of capital. Each challenge represented a “do or die” proposition: Missing the mark on any of them would doom the venture. Assuming a 50 percent chance of a good outcome for any given challenge, the probability of getting five out of five good outcomes is the same as the odds of picking the winning number in roulette: 3 percent. To win such a gamble, these entrepreneurs were betting on Cascading Miracles.

But what about bootstrapped ventures that never raise any equity from outside investors? A bootstrapping entrepreneur’s investment equals the sum of 1) his “sweat equity,” the gap between what he pays himself and what he could have earned by working elsewhere, and 2) the capital he personally contributed. If this investment exceeds the amount of cash the entrepreneur can ever expect to get back in the form of dividends or merger proceeds, then the venture has failed.

If you make something users want, you’ll probably be fine, whatever else you do or don’t do. And if you don’t make something users want, then you’re dead, whatever else you do or don’t do.”

Of the four opportunity elements, an early-stage startup’s customer value proposition is without question the most important. To survive, a new venture absolutely must offer a sustainably differentiated solution for strong, unmet customer needs. This point bears repeating: Needs must be strong. If an unknown startup’s product doesn’t address an acute pain point, customers aren’t likely to buy it. Likewise, differentiation is crucial: If the venture’s offering is not superior in meaningful ways to existing solutions, again, no one will buy it. Finally, sustaining this differentiation is important. Without barriers to imitation, the venture is vulnerable to copycats.

Such barriers—called “moats” by some entrepreneurs—come in two types: proprietary assets and business model attributes. Proprietary assets are either difficult to duplicate or are in scarce supply. Examples include trusted brand names, patents, a great location for a retail store, and preemptive access to a key raw material—like Beyond Burger’s long-term contract locking up a large percentage of the world’s supply of pea protein. Business model attributes are those that can confer an advantage in attracting and retaining customers, like high customer switching costs and strong network effects.

Examples include trusted brand names, patents, a great location for a retail store, and preemptive access to a key raw material—like Beyond Burger’s long-term contract locking up a large percentage of the world’s supply of pea protein. Business model attributes are those that can confer an advantage in attracting and retaining customers, like high customer switching costs and strong network effects. Switching costs aren’t just financial expenditures; they can also include inconveniences and risks incurred when a customer changes from one vendor to another. Consider, for example, the costs and risks when switching dog walkers. A family must trust the new walker with keys to their residence, must brief the new walker on their pet’s patterns and preferences, and run the risk that their dog may not take to this new human in its life. Switching costs can be a double-edged sword. For example, to attract customers, Baroo had to overcome these barriers. However, once it did, Baroo retained customers because they faced the high cost of switching to a competitor. With network effects, a product becomes more valuable to any given user as it adds more users. Online dating is a prime example: A site that offers access to a greater number of potential romantic partners has more appeal. Due to strong network effects in online dating, startups like Triangulate struggle at the outset to attract users—another Catch-22, because they need users in order to get users. But if they can gain momentum, a flywheel kicks in, as new users attract more new users. After they reach critical mass, such businesses have an edge over rivals in attracting and retaining customers.

But creating a single product that meets the different needs of multiple segments can result in a bloated, unfocused offering—one that aims to be all things to all people but does not delight anyone. Likewise, marketing to multiple customer segments can be difficult and expensive because promotional messages must be tailored for each segment. An alternative to targeting multiple segments with a single product is creating separate versions of the product, each with different features and branding. This solution takes care of positioning problems but boosts costs and complexity. Either approach to serving multiple customer segments—relying on one product or separate versions—poses the risk of product development delays, which can be detrimental, especially in fast-moving technology markets. Many startups target a single segment upon launch because it speeds their time to market, and, by catering to a single segment’s needs, allows them to capture a bigger share of a smaller market. It’s easier to defend a stronghold like that and to expand from it. After launching, the startup can then try to modify its product and/or marketing approach in an effort to reach additional customer segments.

Customers are drawn to products that balance novelty with familiarity, so innovation poses a Goldilocks trade-off for entrepreneurs. Without enough of it, a startup’s product will not be meaningfully differentiated from those of existing competitors. A startup that offers a “middling mousetrap”—rather than a better one—probably will fail. At the other extreme, a startup that attempts too much innovation can overshoot customers’ needs. It will incur major marketing costs in an effort to persuade customers to try its radical solution.

LTV/CAC Ratio: A customer’s lifetime value (LTV) equals the discounted present value of the gross profit earned over the life of a typical customer’s relationship with the venture. “Discounted present value” accounts for the fact that a dollar received in the future isn’t as valuable as a dollar received today, because you can put today’s dollar in the bank and earn some interest until the future dollar arrives. Essentially, LTV deducts these forgone interest payments from future dollars earned. Customer acquisition cost (CAC) reflects the average marketing cost incurred in acquiring a typical customer. An LTV/CAC ratio below 1.0 implies that a customer is worth less than it cost to bring her on board. If a startup’s LTV/CAC ratio remains below 1.0 for an extended period, it is probably doomed because it won’t earn enough gross profit to cover fixed overhead costs and earn a net profit. For this reason, many startups target an LTV/CAC

Marc Andreessen likens a startup targeting a big company for a strategic partnership to Captain Ahab and Moby Dick, respectively. Spoiler alert, if you haven’t read the book: It doesn’t end well for Ahab. After chasing Moby Dick for decades, the obsessed Ahab finally harpoons the whale, who drags Ahab beneath the waves and drowns him. Andreessen explains: “The downside of dealing with a big company is that he can capsize you—maybe by stepping on you in one way or another and killing you, but more likely by wrapping you up in a bad partnership that ends up holding you back, or just making you waste a huge amount of time in meetings and get distracted.”

Partnerships can misfire for several reasons—and the larger the power imbalance between the players, the more likely a deal will never happen, or if it does, that it will eventually derail. In some cases, it can take a long time to secure commitment. As Houston suggests, some big companies are just “kicking the tires” to learn about a startup’s technology and strategy—and maybe steal some ideas. For others who might be genuinely interested, the partnership is nevertheless low on the big company’s priority list. Also, big company dealmakers often deliberately drag out negotiations to build bargaining advantage. They know that the startup is burning cash in the meantime and might make concessions out of desperation. Once a deal is struck, partners may renege on promises. Big company politics can be opaque, and parties threatened by the partnership may seek to sabotage it. Or, the partnership’s champion may exit the company, leaving the startup without internal support. In whatever way the relationship goes sour, the venture may still be stuck with that partner.

If the root cause of false positives is misinterpreting signals about early adopters, then entrepreneurs should take two steps to obtain more reliable market feedback. First, they should conduct early customer research that exposes any differences between likely early adopters and mainstream customers. Second, when entrepreneurs are pleasantly surprised by the positive responses from early adopters after the venture has launched, they should consider the possibility that the broader market may not respond in the same way.

Scope Entrepreneurs generally make one of two strategic decisions about scope. With the first—the more common of the two—an entrepreneur gradually expands her startup’s scope as it matures—starting narrow and then broadening over time. With the second, an entrepreneur commits to ambitious scope right from the outset—usually with respect to radical innovation, but sometimes planning for ambitious vertical integration and geographic sprawl, too. If these bold commitments turn out to be “a bridge too far,” the consequences usually manifest themselves quickly, and the startup becomes an early-stage disaster—it never gets funded or dies within a year or two. However, in Chapter 9, we’ll see that a few founders who commit to audaciously ambitious scope do manage to attract enough resources to scale their ventures for many years. These “big bang” startups are often founded by high-profile, charismatic entrepreneurs who can spin up a reality-distortion field to persuade investors, talented employees, and others to help them pursue their “change the world” vision.

Yet, in the “Ready?” section above, I recommended an LTV/CAC ratio greater than 1.0, to ensure that a startup can cover its fixed costs and earn a profit. When strong network effects impel a startup to Get Big Fast, however, fixed costs and profits can wait for a while. Eventually, the LTV/CAC threshold should be boosted above 1.0, but only after the network has achieved critical mass.

When strong network effects impel a startup to Get Big Fast, however, fixed costs and profits can wait for a while. Eventually, the LTV/CAC threshold should be boosted above 1.0, but only after the network has achieved critical mass. The second twist recognizes that with network effects, customers beget customers. LTV calculations can take this into account by factoring in their product’s projected viral coefficient (“v”)—that is, the number of additional new customers attracted by each new customer. Specifically, entrepreneurs should calculate LTV by multiplying the gross margin earned, over time, from a single customer by 1 + v. If the discounted present value of the gross margin from a single customer is $100, and if each new customer attracts, on average, 0.5 additional new customers, then customer lifetime value (LTV) equals $100 x (1 + v), that is, $100 x 1.5, or $150. So, if the target LTV/CAC ratio is 1.0, then this startup can afford to spend up to $150 per new customer on paid marketing. Contrast that to the maximum CAC for a software-as-a-service (SaaS) startup without network effects that happens also to earn $100 in gross margin from each customer. With a 3.0 target LTV/CAC ratio, as proposed in the “Ready?” section, that SaaS startup could spend only $33 to acquire each new customer. That’s a huge difference in the maximum affordable CAC and shows how network effects can motivate aggressive marketing.

Given these dynamics, high switching costs can spur a race in which first-time customers are the prize. First-time customers are new to a product category and they don’t yet have an affiliation with any provider. Consequently, compared to stealing a rival’s customers, first-time buyers will be much cheaper to acquire. They won’t incur any switching costs upon purchasing, so they don’t require a subsidy. Lower CAC means that first-time customers are more profitable to serve, and they also broaden the startup’s total addressable market. Specifically, with lower CAC, the startup can afford to acquire first-time buyers who have lower LTV, while still keeping their LTV/CAC ratio within an acceptable range.

Brooks’s law holds that adding manpower to a late engineering project makes it later. The reasons: New engineers have to come up to speed on what’s been done, it takes more time to coordinate the efforts of a bigger team, and many engineering tasks are not divisible. To illustrate the last point, Fred Brooks notes in his classic book on the management of software development projects, The Mythical Man Month, that nine women can’t make a baby in one month.

As a result, when weighing risks and potential payoffs of strategic moves, each investor may be tempted to focus on her own venture capital firm’s narrow interests rather than her fiduciary duty as a board member to balance the interests of all stakeholders. If narrow interests dominate, the board may not be able to reach consensus on strategic direction. To confront this problem head-on, Return Path founder/CEO Matt Blumberg gave each of his board directors two baseball hats—one black and one white—representing their dual roles as investor and fiduciary. When debating strategic options, Blumberg asked the directors to switch hats at intervals to voice concerns from the other point of view.

One theme common to all of these failures, however, is that the decisions that led to failure were made when the leaders in question were widely regarded as among the best companies in the world. 8 There are two ways to resolve this paradox. One might be to conclude that firms such as Digital, IBM, Apple, Sears, Xerox, and Bucyrus Erie must never have been well managed. Maybe they were successful because of good luck and fortuitous timing, rather than good management. Maybe they finally fell on hard times because their good fortune ran out. Maybe. An alternative explanation, however, is that these failed firms were as well-run as one could expect a firm managed by mortals to be—but that there is something about the way decisions get made in successful organizations that sows the seeds of eventual failure.

It shows that in the cases of well-managed firms such as those cited above, good management was the most powerful reason they failed to stay atop their industries. Precisely because these firms listened to their customers, invested aggressively in new technologies that would provide their customers more and better products of the sort they wanted, and because they carefully studied market trends and systematically allocated investment capital to innovations that promised the best returns, they lost their positions of leadership.

Given that aim, technology, as used in this book, means the processes by which an organization transforms labor, capital, materials, and information into products and services of greater value. All firms have technologies. A retailer like Sears employs a particular technology to procure, present, sell, and deliver products to its customers, while a discount warehouse retailer like PriceCostco employs a different technology. This concept of technology therefore extends beyond engineering and manufacturing to encompass a range of marketing, investment, and managerial processes. Innovation refers to a change in one of these technologies.

Most new technologies foster improved product performance. I call these sustaining technologies. Some sustaining technologies can be discontinuous or radical in character, while others are of an incremental nature. What all sustaining technologies have in common is that they improve the performance of established products, along the dimensions of performance that mainstream customers in major markets have historically valued. Most technological advances in a given industry are sustaining in character. An important finding revealed in this book is that rarely have even the most radically difficult sustaining technologies precipitated the failure of leading firms.

Generally, disruptive technologies underperform established products in mainstream markets. But they have other features that a few fringe (and generally new) customers value. Products based on disruptive technologies are typically cheaper, simpler, smaller, and, frequently, more convenient to use.

The last element of the failure framework, the conclusion by established companies that investing aggressively in disruptive technologies is not a rational financial decision for them to make, has three bases. First, disruptive products are simpler and cheaper; they generally promise lower margins, not greater profits. Second, disruptive technologies typically are first commercialized in emerging or insignificant markets. And third, leading firms’ most profitable customers generally don’t want, and indeed initially can’t use, products based on disruptive technologies. By and large, a disruptive technology is initially embraced by the least profitable customers in a market.

The highest-performing companies, in fact, are those that are the best at this, that is, they have well-developed systems for killing ideas that their customers don’t want. As a result, these companies find it very difficult to invest adequate resources in disruptive technologies—lower-margin opportunities that their customers don’t want—until their customers want them. And by then it is too late.

With few exceptions, the only instances in which mainstream firms have successfully established a timely position in a disruptive technology were those in which the firms’ managers set up an autonomous organization charged with building a new and independent business around the disruptive technology. Such organizations, free of the power of the customers of the mainstream company, ensconce themselves among a different set of customers—those who want the products of the disruptive technology. In other words, companies can succeed in disruptive technologies when their managers align their organizations with the forces of resource dependence, rather than ignoring or fighting them.

In many instances, leadership in sustaining innovations—about which information is known and for which plans can be made—is not competitively important. In such cases, technology followers do about as well as technology leaders. It is in disruptive innovations, where we know least about the market, that there are such strong first-mover advantages. This is the innovator’s dilemma.

People are quite flexible, in that they can be trained to succeed at quite different things. An employee of IBM, for example, can quite readily change the way he or she works, in order to work successfully in a small start-up company. But processes and values are not flexible. A process that is effective at managing the design of a minicomputer, for example, would be ineffective at managing the design of a desktop personal computer. Similarly, values that cause employees to prioritize projects to develop high-margin products, cannot simultaneously accord priority to low-margin products. The very processes and values that constitute an organization’s capabilities in one context, define its dis abilities in another context.

The fear of cannibalizing sales of existing products is often cited as a reason why established firms delay the introduction of new technologies. As the Seagate-Conner experience illustrates, however, if new technologies enable new market applications to emerge, the introduction of new technology may not be inherently cannibalistic. But when established firms wait until a new technology has become 32 commercially mature in its new applications and launch their own version of the technology only in response to an attack on their home markets, the fear of cannibalization can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Finding new applications and markets for these new products seems to be a capability that each of these firms exhibited once, upon entry, and then apparently lost. It was as if the leading firms were held captive by their customers, enabling attacking 34 entrant firms to topple the incumbent industry leaders each time a disruptive technology emerged.16

In one incident recounted in Tracy Kidder’s Pulitzer Prize-winning narrative, The Soul of a New Machine, Data General engineers developing a next-generation minicomputer intended to leapfrog the product position of Digital Equipment Corporation were allowed by a friend of one team member into his facility in the middle of the night to examine Digital’s latest computer, which his company had just bought. When Tom West, Data General’s project leader and a former long-time Digital employee, removed the cover of the DEC minicomputer and examined its structure, he saw “Digital’s organization chart in the design of the product.”2

Although the goods and services constituting such a system of use may all be produced within a single, extensively integrated corporation such as AT&T or IBM, most are tradable, especially in more mature markets. This means that, while Figure 2.1 is drawn to describe the nested physical architecture of a product system, it also implies the existence of a nested network of producers and markets through which the components at each level are made and sold to integrators at the next higher level in the system. Firms that design and assemble disk drives, for example, such as Quantum and Maxtor, procure read-write heads from firms specializing in the manufacture of those heads, and they buy disks from other firms and spin motors, actuator motors, and integrated circuitry from still others. At the next higher level, firms that design and assemble computers may buy their integrated circuits, terminals, disk drives, IC packaging, and power supplies from various firms that manufacture those particular products. This nested commercial system is a value network.

Competition within the value networks in which companies are embedded defines in many ways how the firms can earn their money. The network defines the customers’ problems to be addressed by the firm’s products and services and how much can be paid for solving them. Competition and customer demands in the value network in many ways shape the firms’ cost structure, the firm size required to remain competitive, and the necessary rate of growth. Thus, managerial decisions that make sense for companies outside a value network may make no sense at all for those within it, and vice versa. We saw, in chapter 1, a stunningly consistent pattern of successful implementation of sustaining innovations by established firms and their failure to deal with disruptive ones. The pattern was consistent because the managerial decisions that led to those outcomes made sense. Good managers do what makes sense, and what makes sense is primarily shaped by their value network.

This is so because such technologies generate no value within the established network. The only way established firms can lead 56 in commercializing such technologies is to enter the value network in which they create value. As Richard Tedlow noted in his history of retailing in America (in which supermarkets and discount retailing play the role of disruptive technologies), “the most formidable barrier the established firms faced is that they did not want to do this.”25

In these instances, although this “attacker’s advantage” is associated with a disruptive technology change, the essence of the attacker’s advantage is in the ease with which entrants, relative to incumbents, can identify and make strategic commitments to attack and develop emerging market applications, or value networks. At its core, therefore, the issue may be the relative flexibility of successful established firms versus entrant firms to change strategies and cost structures, not technologies.

Indeed, disruptive technologies have such a devastating impact because the firms that first commercialized each generation of disruptive disk drives chose not to remain contained within their initial value network. Rather, they reached as far upmarket as they could in each new product generation, until their drives packed the capacity to appeal to the value networks above them. It is this upward mobility that makes disruptive technologies so dangerous to established firms—and so attractive to entrants.

In most organizations, managers’ careers receive a big boost when they play a key sponsorship role in very successful projects—and their careers can be permanently derailed if they have the bad judgment or misfortune to back projects that fail. Middle managers aren’t penalized for all failures, of course. Projects that fail because the technologists couldn’t deliver, for example, often are not (necessarily) regarded as failures at all, because a lot is learned from the effort and because technology development is generally regarded as an unpredictable, probabilistic endeavor. But projects that fail because the market wasn’t there have far more serious implications for managers’ careers. These tend to be much more expensive and public failures.

For an organization to accomplish a task as complex as launching a new product, logic, energy, and impetus must all coalesce behind the effort. Hence, it is not just the customers of an established firm that hold it captive to their needs. Established firms are also captive to the financial structure and organizational culture inherent in the value network in which they compete—a captivity that can block any rationale for timely investment in the next wave of disruptive technology.

Probably the most important outcome of this attempt to define the problem is that it ruled out poor management as a root cause. Again, this is not to say that good and bad management aren’t key factors affecting the fortunes of firms. But as a general explanation, the managers of the companies studied here had a great track record in understanding customers’ future needs, identifying which technologies could best address those needs, and in investing to develop and implement them. It was only when confronted with disruptive technology that they failed. There had, therefore, to be a reason why good managers consistently made wrong decisions when faced with disruptive technological change. The reason is that good management itself was the root cause. Managers played the game the way it was supposed to be played. The very decision-making and resource-allocation processes that are key to the success of established companies are the very processes that reject disruptive technologies: listening carefully to customers; tracking competitors’ actions carefully; and investing resources to design and build higher-performance, higher-quality products that will yield greater profit. These are the reasons why great firms stumbled or failed when confronted with disruptive technological change.

There were, in fact, five fundamental principles of organizational nature that managers in the successful firms consistently recognized and harnessed. The firms that lost their battles with disruptive technologies chose to ignore or fight them. These principles are: 1. Resource dependence: Customers effectively control the patterns of resource allocation in well-run companies. 2. Small markets don’t solve the growth needs of large companies. 3. The ultimate uses or applications for disruptive technologies are unknowable in advance. Failure is an intrinsic step toward success. 4. Organizations have capabilities that exist independently of the capabilities of the people who work within them. Organizations’ capabilities reside in their processes and their values—and the very processes and values that constitute their core capabilities within the current business model also define their disabilities when confronted with disruption. 5. Technology supply may not equal market demand. The attributes that make disruptive technologies unattractive in established markets often are the very ones that constitute their greatest value in emerging markets.

How did the successful managers harness these principles to their advantage? 1. They embedded projects to develop and commercialize disruptive technologies within an organization whose customers needed them. When managers aligned a disruptive innovation with the “right” customers, customer demand increased the probability that the innovation would get the resources it needed. 2. They placed projects to develop disruptive technologies in organizations small enough to get excited about small opportunities and small wins. 3. They planned to fail early and inexpensively in the search for the market for a disruptive technology. They found that their markets generally coalesced through an iterative process of trial, learning, and trial again. 4. They utilized some of the resources of the mainstream organization to address the disruption, but they were careful not to leverage its processes and values. They created different ways of working within an organization whose values and cost structure were turned to the disruptive task at hand. 5. When commercializing disruptive technologies, they found or developed new markets that valued the attributes of the disruptive products, rather than search for a technological breakthrough so that the disruptive product could compete as a sustaining technology in mainstream markets.

This observation supports a somewhat controversial theory called resource dependence, propounded by a minority of management scholars,1 which posits that companies’ freedom of action is limited to satisfying the needs of those entities outside the firm (customers and investors, primarily) that give it the resources it needs to survive. Drawing heavily upon concepts from biological evolution, resource dependence theorists assert that organizations will survive and prosper only if their staffs and systems serve the needs of customers and investors by providing them with the products, services, and profit they require. Organizations that do not will ultimately die off, starved of the revenues they need to survive.2 Hence, through this survival-of-the-fittest mechanism, those firms that rise to prominence in their industries generally will be those whose people and processes are most keenly tuned to giving their customers what they want.

In contrast to the evidence that leadership in sustaining technologies has historically conferred little advantage on the pioneering disk drive firms, there is strong evidence that leadership in disruptive technology has been very important. The companies that entered the new value networks enabled by disruptive generations of disk drives within the first two years after those drives appeared were six times more likely to succeed than those that entered later.

Every innovation is difficult. That difficulty is compounded immeasurably, however, when a project is embedded in an organization in which most people are continually questioning why the project is being done at all. Projects make sense to people if they address the needs of important customers, if they positively impact the organization’s needs for profit and growth, and if participating in the project enhances the career opportunities of talented employees. When a project doesn’t have these characteristics, its manager spends much time and energy justifying why it merits resources and cannot manage the project as effectively. Frequently in such circumstances, the best people do not want to be associated with the project—and when things get tight, projects viewed as nonessential are the first to be canceled or postponed.

What this means, however, is that much of what the best executives in successful companies have learned about managing innovation is not relevant to disruptive technologies. Most marketers, for example, have been schooled extensively, at universities and on the job, in the important art of listening to their customers, but few have any theoretical or practical training in how to discover markets that do not yet exist. The problem with this lopsided experience base is that when the same analytical and decision-making processes learned in the school of sustaining innovation are applied to enabling or disruptive technologies, the effect on the company can be paralyzing. These processes demand crisply quantified information when none exists, accurate estimates of financial returns when neither revenues nor costs can be known, and management according to detailed plans and budgets that cannot be formulated. Applying inappropriate marketing, investment, and management processes can render good companies incapable of creating the new markets in which enabling or disruptive technologies are first used.

Research has shown, in fact, that the vast majority of successful new business ventures abandoned their original business strategies when they began implementing their initial plans and learned what would and would not work in the market.9 The dominant difference between successful ventures and failed ones, generally, is not the astuteness of their original strategy. Guessing the right strategy at the outset isn’t nearly as important to success as conserving enough resources (or having the relationships with trusting backers or investors) so that new business initiatives get a second or third stab at getting it right. Those that run out of resources or credibility before they can iterate toward a viable strategy are the ones that fail.

Processes are defined or evolve de facto to address specific tasks. This means that when managers use a process to execute the tasks for which it was designed, it is likely to perform efficiently. But when the same, seemingly efficient process is employed to tackle a very different task, it is likely to seem slow, bureaucratic, and inefficient. In other words, a process that defines a capability in executing a certain task concurrently defines disabilities in executing other tasks.4

One of the dilemmas of management is that, by their very nature, processes are established so that employees perform recurrent tasks in a consistent way, time after time. To ensure consistency, they are 130 meant not to change—or if they must change, to change through tightly controlled procedures. This means that the very mechanisms through which organizations create value are intrinsically inimical to change.

This situation is reminiscent of IBM’s 1984 acquisition of Rolm. There wasn’t anything in Rolm’s pool of resources that IBM didn’t already have. It was Rolm’s processes for developing PBX products and for finding new markets for them that was really responsible for its success. In 1987 IBM decided to fully integrate the company into its corporate structure. Trying to push Rolm’s resources—its products and its customers—through the same processes that were honed in its large computer business, caused the Rolm business to stumble badly. And inviting executives of a computer company whose values had been whetted on operating profit margins of 18 percent to get excited about prioritizing products with operating margins below 10 percent was impossible. IBM’s decision to integrate Rolm actually destroyed the very source of the original worth of the deal. As this chapter is being written in February 2000, DaimlerChrysler, bowing to the investment community’s drumbeat for efficiency savings, now stands on the edge of the same precipice.

Generally, once the performance level demanded of a particular attribute has been achieved, customers indicate their satiation by being less willing to pay a premium price for continued improvement in that attribute. Hence, performance oversupply triggers a shift in the basis of competition, and the criteria used by customers to choose one product over another changes to attributes for which market demands are not yet satisfied.

In the instances studied in this book, established firms confronted with disruptive technology typically viewed their primary development challenge as a technological one: to improve the disruptive technology enough that it suits known markets. In contrast, the firms that were most successful in commercializing a disruptive technology were those framing their primary development challenge as a marketing one: to build or find a market where product competition occurred along dimensions that favored the disruptive attributes of the product.4 It is critical that managers confronting disruptive technology observe this principle. If history is any guide, companies that keep disruptive technologies bottled up in their labs, working to improve them until they suit mainstream markets, will not be nearly as successful as firms that find markets that embrace the attributes of disruptive technologies as they initially stand. These latter firms, by creating a commercial base and then moving upmarket, will ultimately address the mainstream market much more effectively than will firms that have framed disruptive technology as a laboratory, rather than a marketing, challenge.

Because established companies are so prone to push for high-performance, high-profit products and markets, they find it very difficult not to overload their first disruptive products with features and functionality. Hewlett-Packard’s experience in designing its 1.3-inch Kittyhawk disk drive teaches just this lesson. Unable to design a product that was truly simple and cheap, Kittyhawk’s champions pushed its capacity to the limits of technology and gave it levels of shock resistance and power consumption that would make it competitive as a sustaining product. When very high volume applications for a cheap, simple, single-function, 10 MB drive began to emerge, HP’s product was not disruptive enough to catch that wave. Apple committed a similar error in stretching the functionality of its Newton, instead of initially targeting simplicity and reliability.

Scott Cook, Intuit’s founder, surmised that most of these small companies were run by proprietors who relied more on their intuition and direct knowledge of the business than on the information contained in accounting reports. In other words, Cook decided that the makers of accounting software for small businesses had overshot the functionality required by that market, thus creating an opportunity for a disruptive software technology that provided adequate, not superior functionality and was simple and more convenient to use. Intuit’s disruptive Quickbooks changed the basis of product competition from functionality to convenience and captured 70 percent of its market within two years of its introduction.7

Nitrogen’s abundance in plants cannot be missed: it is the nutrient responsible for the vigorous vegetative growth, for the deep green of the leaves, for their large size and delayed senescence, as well as for the size and protein content of cereal grains, the staples of mankind. Nitrogen defciency cannot be missed either: pale green or yellowing leaves, slow and stunted plant growth, low yields and depressed protein content of seeds

But while photosynthesis draws readily on fairly small stores of CO2 in the atmosphere to get the needed carbon, atmosphere’s huge dinitrogen store is highly nonreactive, and availability of reactive nitrogen is almost always the most important factor limiting the yields in intensive agricultures

Lightning is the only physical process that can fx substantial amounts of nitrogen, that is, to split the tightly bound molecule so the freed atoms can form reactive compounds. Although we cannot pinpoint the annual fux of this high-energy fxation, its global contribution clearly falls far short of agriculture’s nitrogen needs. And there is only one group of living organisms capable of nitrogen fxation: about 100 bacterial genera, most notably Rhizobium bacteria associated with the roots of leguminous plants. Not surprisingly, agricultures have been preoccupied with manipulating the fows of reactive nitrogen. Traditional farming relied on a combination of increasingly intensive recycling of organic wastes and cultivation of leguminous plants, but these inputs were insuffcient to sustain high crop yields over large cultivated areas

We can pinpoint—much like with Edison’s lightbulb or the Wright brothers’ fight—the time of the decisive breakthrough. Archives of Badische Anilin- & Soda-Fabrik (BASF) in Ludwigshafen contain a letter that Fritz Haber, at that time a professor of physical chemistry and electrochemistry at the Technische Hochschule in Karslruhe, sent on July 3, 1909, to the company’s directors. In it he described the events of the previous day, when two BASF chemists came to witness the frst successful demonstration of the synthesis in his laboratory. Haber’s invention was translated with an unprecedented rapidity into a commercial synthetic process by Carl Bosch. The Haber–Bosch process was the breakthrough that removed the most ubiquitous limit on crop yields, opening the way for the development and adoption of high-yielding cultivars and for the multiplication of global harvests

Rich countries could fertilize much less by cutting their excessive food production in general, and by reducing their high intakes of animal foods in particular—but even the most assiduous recycling of all organic wastes and the widest practical planting of legumes could not supply enough nitrogen for land-scarce, poor, and populous nations. All the children to be seen running around or leading docile water buffaloes in China’s southern provinces, throughout the Nile Delta, or in the manicured landscapes of Java got their body proteins, via urea their parents spread on bunded felds, from the Haber–Bosch synthesis of ammonia. Without this synthesis about 2/5 of the world’s population would not be around—and the dependence will only increase as the global count moves from 6 to 9 or 10 billion people

While the world’s population stores no more than about 6 million tonnes of nitrogen (less than one-billionth of the atmosphere’s enormous nitrogen stores), in order to maintain, and to gradually expand, this negligible reservoir, the reactive nitrogen in synthetic fertilizers is now perhaps equal to half of the total fxed by all bacteria in all natural terrestrial ecosystems. Moreover, in every intensively cultivated region, and especially where large-scale agriculture neighbors cities and industry, inputs from human activity are greatly surpassing natural fows of fxed nitrogen. On smaller scales, from local watersheds to individual felds, they dominate natural fows by more than an order of magnitude. Transformations of these nitrogen inputs intensify the rates of microbial processing and increase the atmospheric emissions and deposition of nitrogen compounds and their leaching to fresh and coastal waters. We are thus fertilizing not just felds but, indirectly, also many natural ecosystems—and interfering in nitrogen’s natural fows to a much higher extent than in the case of other biospheric cycles

In spite of these experiments the idea that humus (a mixture of complex organic compounds resulting from the decomposition of biomass) is the dominant source of carbon, as well as other elements needed by plants, remained highly infuential. The humus theory was favored by writings of Daniel Thaer (1752–1828), a Prussian professor of agriculture,5 and de Saussure himself continued to believe that humus has a key role in plant growth; it was resolutely defeated only two generations later. Karl Sprengel (1787–1859) and Justus von Liebig (1803–1873) deserve most of the credit for disproving the humus theory

Less than a decade before Hellriegel’s lecture, a convincing experiment demonstrated the bacterial origins of nitrifcation, conversion of ammonia to nitrate. This reaction is of great importance for all crops because nitrates are much more soluble than ammonia is, and plant roots can absorb them more readily from solutions in soil. But it was only in 1877 when The´ophile Schloesing (1824–1919) designed a convincing experiment proving the bacterial origins of nitrifcation.59 All of the ammonia in sewage trickling through a tube flled with sand and chalk was converted to nitrate in a few days. Addition of chloroform to the liquid terminated the process by killing all microbes, but recharging of the tube with a small lump of fresh soil restarted the conversion. But identifying the bacteria responsible for the oxidation proved elusive as long as the researchers used organic media

Return of the element from nitrate to its huge atmospheric reservoir as a simple dinitrogen molecule was explained shortly before Hellriegel’s presentation. In 1885 Ulysse Gayon (1845–1929) and his assistants fnally isolated pure cultures of two bacteria that could reduce nitrates, and they named the process denitrifcation.61 This stepwise process frst reduces nitrates to nitrites; NO and N2O may be the subsequent intermediate products, and N2 is its fnal product. Unlike nitrifcation, which is dominated by just two bacterial genera, denitrifcation is carried out by a variety of microorganisms able to use the oxygen in nitrates for their respiration as they feed on many organic substrates. Pseudomonas, Bacillus, and Alcaligenes are the most common denitrifying genera.62 Gayon’s fundamental discovery literally closed the biospheric nitrogen cycle

Use of legumes as green manure has also a long tradition. This practice incorporates plants of various legume species (mostly cover crops) into soil by hoeing or plowing, or, less commonly, by harvesting the plants and burying them in other felds. The incorporation comes sometime after just 40, but usually after 60–120, days after their planting. In a mild climate several months of their winter growth added enough nitrogen to the soil to produce a good summer cereal crop.

Amountsofnitrogenprovidedbytraditionallegumesisalmostasdiffcultto estimate as the contributions of animal manures. Because the nodulation of different legumes requires the presence of particular rhizobial strains in the soil, biofxation rates vary enormously with both abundance and persistence of specifc bacteria. Fixation rates also vary with the host’s photosynthetic output and with environmental stresses. Major factors reducing, or even inhibiting, nitrogen fxation include high soil temperature, both too little and too much moisture, low soil O2 levels, high concentrations of inorganic forms of nitrogen (especially of nitrates), shortages of potassium and of essential micronutrients—particularly molybdenum, vanadium, and iron present in the redox center of nitrogenase—and low soil pH.43 As a result, we are still unable to offer reliable, representative values of average annual fxation rates even for the most important leguminous cultivars (appendix C).44

Nearly a century after its invention the Haber–Bosch process of ammonia synthesis from its elements remains fundamentally unchanged, yet at the same time radically transformed (fg. 6.1). This is only a seemingly contradictory statement: while Haber and Bosch would have the satisfaction of recognizing the essentials of their creation in today’s modern ammonia plants, they would be amazed at the size of individual operations and at their effciency, and they would certainly admire many innovations, large and small, that have made ammonia synthesis into one of the most remarkable industrial undertakings of modern civilization

Naturally, average worldwide energy effciency of ammonia synthesis—which is affected by more energy-intensive reforming of heavier hydrocarbons and coal— has improved as well: before 1955 the global mean of energy consumption in all ammonia plants (natural gas, oil, and coal-based) was at least 80 GJ/t NH3, by 1965 it declined to just over 60 GJ/t, and by 1980 it was a bit more than 50 GJ/t.68 The best estimate for the late 1990s would be between 40–45 GJ/t.69 Even with these huge improvements the synthesis of ammonia remains an energyintensive process, particularly when compared to the production of other inorganic fertilizers. Energy requirements for producing phosphorous fertilizers add up to as little as 15 GJ/t P for phosphate rock and as much as nearly 30 GJ/t for complex P-containing compounds.70 Mining, crushing, and benefciation of potash (KCl) usually does not cost more than 10 GJ/t of the nutrient.71 As we will see in the next chapter, only a small part of synthesized ammonia is used directly as a fertilizer: conversion of NH3 to liquid and solid nitrogen fertilizers that dominate the feld applications requires a considerable amount of additional energy.72

Global production of nitrogen fertilizers thus requires about nine times as much energy as the combined output of P and K compounds. Even if all of the energy needed to fx the fertilizer nitrogen would come from natural gas, it would be just 5% of the recent annual global consumption of the fuel, and about 1.3% of all energy derived from fossil fuels.

Looking ahead, there is no doubt that higher absolute energy needs brought about by rising demand for nitrogen fertilizers (see chapter 8) will be partially offset by lower requirements for nitrogen fxation and by higher effciencies of fertilizer use (see chapter 10). Moreover, today’s low-income countries will see much faster growth of energy needs in sectors other than the fertilizer industry.77 As a result, the share of global fossil fuel consumption claimed by nitrogen fxation by the middle of the twenty-frst century may be only marginally higher than it is today.78 Clearly, the future nitrogen fxation needed to produce enough food for the additional 2–4 billion people the planet will house by the year 2050 will not be limited by energy and feedstock supplies

A comprehensive account of nitrogen inputs reaching the world’s farmlands shows that during the 1990s synthetic fertilizers provided about half of the total nutrient available to annual and permanent crops. Expectedly, there are large regional departures from this mean: some export crops aside, nitrogen applications throughout sub-Saharan Africa are either absent or remain extremely low, while the world’s highest rates prevail in the countries of northwestern Europe and East Asia.

determinants of high rates of nitrogen applications are high population densities, scarcity of farmland, and a high share of irrigated cropland. Combination of these variables explains Egypt’s high use of nitrogen, while the rest of the African continent consumes less than 3% of the global supply of the nutrient, although it has about 12% of the world’s population

The part of the world that most urgently needs increased fertilizer use is subSaharan Africa, where an insuffcient supply of nutrients results not just in low crop yields but in the continuing decline of soil fertility. So far the most comprehensive assessment of soil degradation concluded that less than 30% of nitrogen (as well as just 15% K and less than 40% P) needed by the region’s crops is actually replaced by fertilizers.53 In order to stop this degradation the region should quintuple its currently negligible use of nitrogen, averaging a mere 10 kg/ha. In order to ensure the region’s food security this should be done within one decade, and fertilizer use would have to grow by nearly 20% a year.54 In reality, the region’s nitrogen applications actually fell during the early 1990s.

In contrast to sub-Saharan Africa, Asia’s food production has increased considerably, and the rapidly increasing use of nitrogen fertilizers—from 18.6 Mt in 1975 to 45 Mt N in 1995—applied to high-yielding rice and wheat crops has accounted for most of that gain.56 East Asian gains have been particularly impressive, and China’s transition from traditional cropping done without any inorganic fertilizers to the world’s largest user of inorganic nitrogen is the best illustration of this rapid transformation.

Three of the world’s most important cereal grains—rice, wheat, and corn—receive the largest share of available nitrogen fertilizers, and some of the highest applications are reserved for these crops, particularly in regions where soils and climate combine to provide optimal growing conditions. Comparisons of nitrogen inputs to rice grown in Jiangsu or Hunan (the two provinces with the highest yields in China), winter wheat grown in northwestern Europe (the highest yields are in the coastal region from the Loire to Denmark and in England), and corn grown in the U.S. Corn Belt (from Indiana in the east to eastern Nebraska in the west, and from northern Missouri to southern Minnesota) show similar shares of fertilizer nitrogen in the total supply of the nutrient

After subtracting the shares retained in milling residues, Jiangsu rice-wheat rotation can produce about 800 kg protein/ha, and Hunanese rotations, centered on the double-cropping of rice, as well as the most productive European wheat monocropping yield between 650 and 700 kg protein/ha.83 This is 2.5–4 times more than the output of the most productive traditional agricultures relying on intensive recycling of organic matter and planting of legumes. With an overwhelmingly vegetarian diet this production could feed 35–45 people/ha, compared to 12–15 people/ha in the best premodern settings.84 Rotations of corn and soybeans in Iowa can produce as much as 850–900 kg of protein/ha, and populations willing to subsist on a vegetarian diet based on these two foodstuffs could support ffty people from every hectare of farmland

Maximum population densities supportable by vegetarian diets would also be quite high in North America and Western Europe, but these highly carnivorous societies now use a great deal of fertilizer nitrogen in order to support that particular dietary habit. Naturally, this reality must be taken into account when trying to estimate the extent of the world’s existential dependence on Haber–Bosch ammonia synthesis, the principal goal of the next chapter

As shown in chapter 2, intensifcation of inputs through organic recycling and planting of nitrogen-fxing legumes is limited by the availability of recyclable crop residues and animal wastes and by the extent of land that can be devoted to green manures. Only the most intensive, and hence spatially restricted, forms of traditional agriculture could have supplied more than 200 kg N/ha. No cropping based on residue and manure recycling, on rotations of cereals with legumes, and on planting of green manures could provide a regular supply of more than 200 kg N/ha over extensive areas.

This means that, everything else being equal, today’s global crop harvest would be cut in half without the applications of nitrogen fertilizers. But this does not mean that roughly half of all the food produced today could not be supplied without nitrogen fertilizer—or that half of the world’s population would not be alive without the Haber–Bosch synthesis

The global per capita mean of the dietary protein supply—about 73 g/day in 1996—is made up of two disparate parts: a huge excess in the high-income nations (1996 per capita mean of almost 100 g/day, including about 55 g from animal foods), and a much less comfortable rate in the low-income countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, where the 1996 per capita mean was about 66 g/day, with only some 18 g coming from animal foods (fg.8.2). 9

In 1996 low-income countries consumed 64% of the world’s nitrogen fertilizers, which provided about 55% of the total nutrient supply reaching their felds.11 As no less than 92% of their food proteins were derived from crops, inorganic fertilizers supplied at least half of all nitrogen in their diets.12 This would be an equivalent of feeding no fewer than 2.2 billion people, or roughly 40% of the world’s 1996 total population. These people now depend on the Haber–Bosch synthesis for what is, as we shall see shortly, still an insuffcient source of their basic food needs, that is, for their very survival

The range of our dependence on the Haber–Bosch synthesis of ammonia thus is as follows: for about 40% of humanity it now provides the very means of survival; only half as many people as are alive today could be supplied by prefertilizer agriculture with very basic, overwhelmingly vegetarian, diets; and prefertilizer farming could provide today’s average diets to only about 40% of the existing population. The only way this global dependence on nitrogen fertilizer could be lowered would be to adopt an unprecedented degree of sharing and restraint

In such a world the populations of affuent countries would have to reduce their meat consumption as hundreds of millions of people would have to revert to simpler diets containing more cereals and legumes.18 Needless to say, the chances of this dietary transformation, running directly against the long-term trend of global nutritional transitions, are extremely slim. But even in such an altruistic and frugal world ammonia synthesis would still have to supply at least 1/3 of all nitrogen assimilated by the global food harvest!19

Meat protein is inherently more costly to produce than fat; for example, the effciency of metabolizable energy conversion to protein in pigs peaks at about 45%, while conversion to fat can be as much as 75% effcient. 36 Feed conversions vary, but even for very effciently produced broilers the rate is more than 4 kg of feed for 1 kg of meat, implying the transformation of at least 400 g of plant proteins into 100 g of meat protein. Protein conversion effciencies for other domestic animals are substantially lower: 10–15% for pork, and just 5– 8% for beef (fg.8.4). 37 An equal mix of chicken, pork, and beef protein would have thus required about seven times as much plant protein to produce. Reducing America’s per capita consumption of animal foods by 1/3 would result in cutting its nitrogen applications used to produce domestically consumed food by about 1/4.38 The total use of fertilizer nitrogen could then decline from 7–7.5 Mt N to 5.3–5.6 Mt N. This would cut the recent nitrogen applications in half, and if the reduced harvest would be produced with lower yields from roughly the same amount of farmland, then ammonia synthesis would supply between 1/3 and 2/5 of all nitrogen inputs. Even then the average annual meat consumption would be close to 80 kg/capita, as high as it is now in Switzerland and higher than in Sweden, and per capita supply of animal proteins would average almost 50 g/day, about as much as it is now in the United Kingdom. 39 Feed (kg/kg of edible weight) Protein content (% of edible weight) Protein conversion efficiency (%) Milk Eggs Chicken Pork Beef Carp Salmon 1.1 3.5 30 2.8 13 30 4.5 20 20 7.3 14 10 20 15 5 2.3 18 20 1.4 22 40 Figure 8.4 Protein conversion effciencies in animal food production

America’s reliance on nitrogen fertilizer then is not a matter of existential, nutritional necessity; rather, it is tied to maintaining a very high (and, from a public health perspective, arguably excessive) consumption of animal foods and generating economic benefts through higher domestic sales of meat and dairy products and through large exports of feeds (primarily grain corn and soybeans), food cereals (wheat, rice), as well as oils, fruits, vegetables, cotton, and animal foodstuffs

There can be no doubt that the transition to low fertility—a shift completely accomplished in all the affuent countries and well advanced in much of Asia and Latin America—is now under way even in sub-Saharan Africa, the largest remaining region of very high fertilities. As a result, the world’s population growth has recently began declining even in absolute terms.57 Depending on the more distant, and as yet uncertain, course of the fertility decline, the global population may be anywhere between 7.3 and 10.7 billion people by the year 2050 (the UN’s latest medium forecast being about 8.9 billion), and it may not increase very much afterwards.58 The conclusion that yet another doubling of world population is unlikely is most welcome news, but it is still a great reason for concern regarding the future food production

Inevitably, during the coming decades the dependence on nitrogen fertilizers would grow even if these countries would merely maintain their current average per capita food supply.That, of course, should not be enough. Nationwide means of per capita protein, and food energy, consumption are above the existential minima in most low-income countries, but in many of them there is hardly any safety margin, and in all of them common distribution inequalities mean that protein malnutrition, as already noted, continues to be widespread

The initial phases of this transition are now clearly noticeable in many relatively better-off lowincome countries. While the poor world’s daily per capita availability of animal protein remains low, it had doubled between 1970 and 1995, and it has roughly tripled in China since the beginning of the country’s modernization drive in the early 1980s.

The minimum scenario of the world’s future dependence on the Haber–Bosch synthesis is not diffcult to construct. According to the medium version of the UN’s long-term population projection, virtually the whole increase of 3 billion people to be added between 2000 and 2050 will be in today’s low-income countries. Merely to maintain their average diets, these countries would have to use at least 85% more nitrogen fertilizer than they do today. Adding at least 10% for eliminating malnutrition and stunting, and another 10% for producing more animal foods, would double their 1995 nitrogen fertilizer consumption.71 With unchanged consumption in affuent countries the world might be using some 140 Mt N in synthetic fertilizers by the year 2050

This would mean that Haber–Bosch fxation would supply 60% of the nutrient reaching the world’s cropland, and its product would be indispensable for ensuring basic nutrition for some 60% of the world’s people. More meaty diets and the necessity of making up harvest losses due to environmental change could further raise the need, and hence the dependence, even higher, but more effcient use of fertilizers, lower food waste, and gradual dietary transformations can combine to lower it substantially. All we can say with certainty is that our dependence on the Haber–Bosch synthesis of ammonia will rise during the next two generations, but its actual level will be determined by a complex interplay of our increasing, and all too often more wasteful, needs and of our innovative and more effcient uses

Haber–Bosch synthesis of ammonia is now the single largest cause of the humandriven intensifcation of the biospheric nitrogen cycle, and its annual output of fxed nitrogen is now almost as large as a conservatively estimated total rate of natural nitrogen fxation on the continents. In relative terms, human activities now perturb the global nitrogen cycle to a greater extent than they interfere in the cycles of the other two doubly mobile elements, carbon and sulfur. But synthesis of inorganic fertilizers is not just the largest cause of the roughly doubled rate of preindustrial nitrogen fxation: the complexity of nitrogen’s biospheric cycling and the element’s double mobility make it inevitable that large fractions of nitrogen fertilizers will not be assimilated by crops

While we are fairly certain that, as a global mean, about half of all nitrogen applied in inorganic fertilizers does not end up in crop tissues, we have much less confdence about apportioning this huge nitrogen loss among the major processes that remove the element from agroecosystems to the atmosphere and to both underground and surface waters

Although the actual rate for the preindustrial natural fxation cannot be pinpointed, it is most likely that in the absence of human activities terrestrial processes fxed between 150 and 200 Mt N annually.1 Fixation by lightning is a minor component of the natural production of reactive nitrogen, which is dominated by symbiotic diazotrophs.2 Of the three principal types of human interference in the nitrogen cycle—synthesis of ammonia, planting of leguminous crops, and combustion of fossil fuels—the frst one is by far the largest

This means that the annual nitrogen fxation by the fertilizer industry alone now approaches the lower estimates of natural terrestrial fxation, and that the combined anthropogenic inputs of some 150 Mt N of reactive nitrogen—100 Mt N from the Haber–Bosch process, about 30 Mt N from legume cultivation, and more than 20 Mt N from fossil fuel combustion—are as large as some estimates of the worldwide aggregate of the element fxed by natural terrestrial ecosystems during the preindustrial era

Yet, as the preceding comparison clearly shows, they too constitute an unprecedented large-scale biogeochemical experiment whose eventual impacts we can predict only poorly. After all, while the tropospheric concentration of CO2 has risen about 30% above the preindustrial level, the atmospheric deposition of NO y and NHx has roughly trebled. And while the human activities now account for about 1/4 of all sulfur compounds released into the environment, they add up to at least 2/5, and perhaps to 1/2, of all terrestrial reactive nitrogen

An argument can be made that the human interference in the global nitrogen cycle deserves special attention, because our existential dependence on the nutrient has no conceivable substitutes. High CO2 emissions could be reduced very effectively by a combination of economic and technical solutions, and the transition to nonfossil energies will be inevitable even without any threat of global climatic change

Not all nitrogen that is not taken up by crops leaves the soil. As explained in chapter 1, appreciable shares of the applied nutrient may be fxed by clay minerals, and the trapped NH4 cations can no longer participate in the rapid cycling of the element in the soil (fg. 9.2). A large part of the trapped nitrogen may be rereleased during the growing season, but some of it remains unavailable to plants, resisting both inorganic breakdown and bacterial attack for extended periods of time. In some soils the mineral-bound NH4 accounts for up to 8% of all nitrogen in the near-surface layer, and up to 2/3 of the element in deeper soil

But the total amount of nitrogen subject to these kinds of redistribution within soils is small compared to losses of fertilizer nitrogen, which are an inevitable part of complex global fuxes of the nutrient. Nitrogen’s easy double mobility—through the air and through the waters—ensures the intensive cycling that is the prerequisite of the element’s perpetual biospheric availability but also the source of unwelcome economic losses and environmental concerns. An individual nitrogen atom can thus be sequentially incorporated in a number of compounds whose very presence, or whose excessive concentration, may be undesirable

Everything else being equal, leaching from bare, fallow, or freshly ploughed soils is much higher than beneath row crops, which, in turn, is considerably higher than from soils under such dense cover crops as legume-grass mixtures whose roots can take up large amounts of added nitrogen. Annual leaching losses range from negligible amounts in arid felds to 20–30 kg N/ha in rainy temperate regions. Maxima of over 50 kg N/ha are not unusual in the most heavily fertilized crop felds of northwestern Europe and the American Midwest and Northeast.

We may thus conclude with a high degree of confdence that half of all the nitrogen added annually to the world’s croplands is lost from the world’s agroecosystems, most of it before it can get incorporated in the harvested biomass. Apportioning this loss among the handful of major causes cannot be done accurately, but even an imprecise attempt is useful as it reveals at least the relative magnitudes of the principal fows, and hence the potential for particular environmental impacts

After rounding these approximations, it can be concluded that almost 30% of all the nitrogen lost from the world’s agroecosystems is directly denitrifed, about 25% is taken away with the eroded soil, another 25% is lost to volatilization from fertilizing compounds, soils, and plant tops, and about 20% is removed by leaching (Appendix Q). Leached nitrates from synthetic fertilizers and manures have caused perhaps the greatest environmental concern because of their potential to affect human health and to transform aquatic ecosystems far downstream from farmed areas. Nitrous oxide produced by denitrifcation is a greenhouse gas, and volatilized ammonia and NO x emitted from soils contribute to the atmospheric deposition of reactive nitrogen

The availability of reactive nitrogen limits photosynthesis in a wide variety of terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Nitrogen limitation is particularly common in temperate and boreal forests, temperate grasslands, and Arctic and subalpine tundra, and in estuaries and coastal marine ecosystems in temperate zones.63 Introduction of relatively large external inputs of the nutrient must be expected to change the productivity of affected ecosystems, as well as the modes of their nitrogen storage and composition of their species.

Enriching streams, lakes, ponds, bays, and estuaries with what is normally a photosynthesis-limiting nutrient promotes the growth of algae. Their decomposition can deoxygenate water and hence seriously affect or kill aquatic species, particularly the bottom dwellers (shellfsh, molluscs). Algal blooms may also cause problems with water fltration and produce harmful toxins. Nitrogen-induced eutrophication threatens above all shallow lakes and coastal waters that receive high infows of the nutrient from the land.

After about three decades of extensive research on acid deposition some of the effects of acidity in regions devoid of any buffering capacity are well known. Leaching of calcium and mobilization of toxic aluminum from soils and often profound changes of plant and heterotrophic species composition in lakes, including the demise of the most sensitive fshes, amphibians and insects, are the most deleterious and indisputably established impacts.71 In contrast, the exact role of acid deposition in the reduced productivity and dieback of some forests remains uncertain

Nitrogen saturation can lead to signifcant changes in ecosystem composition and diversity.Nitrogen-fxing species will become less competitive, and lichens associated with nitrogen-fxing cyanobacteria may retreat. In ecosystems adapted to low nitrogen supply, individual species or whole plant communities may become extinct because a few nitrophilic varieties, able to grow faster under high inputs of the nutrient, will thrive. Declines of plant diversity with rising nitrogen loading have been already observed in grasslands in both North America and Europe and in European heathlands and forests.

In view of these complexities it is diffcult to estimate what effect the nitrogen enrichment already had, and what future impact it might have, on the additional storage of carbon in the terrestrial phytomass.

Published estimates have already credited annual increments as low as 0.2 Gt C and as high as 2.3 Gt C to stimulation by the releases of anthropogenically fxed nitrogen.79 If values close to the upper limit of this range were correct, then the nitrogen-stimulated uptake of carbon would provide a sink large enough to balance global carbon losses from land use changes and phytomass combustion—and it would also solve the puzzle of the missing carbon.80 At this time we do not know how long these enrichment benefts will last, how individual species will respond, how the gains will be partitioned among tree tissues, and what the eventual consequences of competition among species will be.

Future impacts of nitrogen losses from fertilizers will not be simply proportional to the rising nutritional needs of larger global populations. There are many effective ways to improve the effciency of fertilizer use and to reduce undesirable losses through better agronomic practices—and no smaller opportunities for reducing the biospheric throughput of the anthropogenic nitrogen are latent in the composition of our diets

These arrangements bring some impressive economies of scale, but they create environmental problems at both ends. Synthetic fertilizers can provide any conceivable nutrient needs for specialized monocropping, but reduced, or completely absent, recycling of organic wastes gradually lowers the concentrations of the soil’s organic matter. This change has many undesirable consequences for the soil quality, above all greater soil compaction resulting in worsened tilth, easier erodibility, lowered water-holding capacity, and weakened ability to support diverse soil biota and to buffer acid deposition.

On the whole, the record is unsatisfactory because no more than about half of the globally applied inorganic nitrogen fnds its way to plant tissues; mean uptakes are higher in intensive Western agricultures, but considerably lower (even below 30%) in Asia’s rice felds, now the leading consumers of fxed nitrogen. Producing food for larger populations that aspire to a higher standard of living will require substantial increases in the Haber–Bosch synthesis during the frst half of the twentyfrst century, but increasing the supply through expanded synthesis of ammonia should be only one part of meeting that challenge. More effcient fertilizing and more rational diets of stabilized populations can obviate a great number of nitrogen applications and lower the burden on the biosphere

Periodic soil testing does not just provide recommendations for appropriate macronutrient applications. It can also uncover growth-limiting micronutrient defciencies. At the same time, the inherent complexities of N fows in agroecosystems mean that accurate predictions of actual fertilizer demand will be always diffcult.11 Soil testing can make the greatest difference in many low-income countries where too many farmers simply follow general recommendations for fertilizer applications, but the best results might be achieved only when farmers adjust fertilizer application rates to the highly variable nitrogen supply capacity of soils

Proper timing of fertilizer applications is another well-proven way of saving nitrogen: applications should coincide, as much as possible, with periods of the highest nutrient need, which comes generally during the rapid vegetative growth stage before crops shift to reproductive growth.15 Applications many weeks ahead of planting will inevitably increase the risk of substantial losses of nitrogen. Split applications— the initial one before or at the time of planting, the second, or the third one, nearer the time of maximum uptake—are the best choice

Surface applications (broadcasting or sidedressing) are almost always less effcient than subsurface incorporation (broadcasting followed by plowing or disking, row application with seed, deep banding apart from seed).16 But too deep a placement of nutrients may also be wasteful; studies with 15N show that the use of nitrogen decreases appreciably with depth. A counterintuitive result regarding fertilizer placement emerged from a study in Missouri that demonstrated that with adequate water supply applications of nitrogen, and water, in alternate furrows produced a harvest at least equivalent or even higher than those resulting from fertilizing every furrow

Cheaper microcomputers and the commercial availability of global positioning systems (GPS) opened up the possibility of site-specifc applications of fertilizers. Rather than choosing the fertilizer amount according to average conditions within a feld, precision farming adjusts the applied amount according not only to feld-tofeld variations in soil quality but also to often substantial differences of nutrient content within a single feld.18 Maximized yields and profts and minimized nitrogen applications, and hence reduced nutrient losses to the environment, should be the ideal outcome. Evaluations of recent experiments with precision farming have ranged from highly encouraging results to no signifcant difference when compared with standard practices to unproftable experiences, but there is little doubt that the technique will be pursued and perfected in the future

As such a large share of harvest is now fed to animals, further substantial gains in fertilizer effciency could be achieved by integrating or reintegrating crop and animal farming and reversing the spatial separation of the two segments of the trophic pyramid. Such a reconnection would allow for more extensive, and more effcient, recycling of manures, but it would go against the entrenched trend of the increasing separation of the two activities as traditional ways of mixed farming are being replaced by specialized cropping and centralized animal feeding

Reversing another widespread trend—eating more food from more distant places rather than consuming locally produced food (even in places where environmental conditions provide no obstacle to doing so)—would also be extremely helpful in improving the effciency with which nitrogen is used in modern agriculture. But a realistic assessment must conclude that this shift, too, has only a low probability.27 In contrast, chances of an early stabilization of the global population appear to be much greater, and the twentieth century has already seen some desirable long-term changes in the composition of average diets

But I want to stress that in order to keep the total nitrogen applications as low as possible—preferably below 150 Mt N/ year by the mid–twenty-frst century—we should not rely merely on higher rates of nitrogen utilization but also engage in judicious demand management, that is, in infuencing food consumption.

I believe that a rational position is to advocate a moderate consumption of those animal foods that require the largest amount of feed (feedlot-raised beef raised on a mixture of corn and soybeans is the most obvious case in point) and to promote the intake of those foods that can be produced most effciently. The latter category includes above all aquacultured herbivorous fsh, all dairy products, and chicken.43 At the same time, I have to point out that the promotion and widespread adoption of diets considered optimal by modern nutritional science may still entail high, and highly wasteful, applications of nitrogen fertilizers. These diets conform broadly to traditional Mediterranean patterns of relatively frugal consumption dominated by cereals, pulses, vegetables, fruits, nuts, olive oil, cheese, and milk, with the occasional eating of fsh and meat, and with moderate drinking of wine

The Haber–Bosch process is not going to be displaced any time soon, and increased global dependence on this synthesis is inevitable even with an early stabilization of the world population and a widespread adoption of rational diets. Intensive cultivation cannot be sustained without applications of nitrogen fertilizers. The yield increases required to produce larger harvests—needed to provide food for additional 2–4 billion people by 2050, as well as to improve the diets of some 3 billion people— are unthinkable without a substantial overall increase of nitrogen applications

The only proven option that could increase nitrogen inputs without the Haber– Bosch synthesis would be a large expansion of biofxation. There are no biophysical reasons why the current global rate of managed biofxation—most likely between 30 and 35 Mt N/year produced by rhizobia associated with leguminous grains and cover crops—could not be doubled, or even tripled.62 But nutritional preferences, agronomic realities, and carrying-capacity imperatives will greatly limit any future expansion.

Improved effciency of nitrogen fertilization must become a major new source of nitrogen. As shown earlier in this chapter, such gains already have been appreciable in affuent countries. There is no doubt that it will be much more diffcult to adopt the highly managed, information-rich farming that is required to achieve such savings in low-income countries, whose food requirements will generate nearly all of the world’s additional needs for nitrogen fertilizers. But this, of course, is precisely the reason for engaging the farmers of these countries in the quest for gradual savings

The extent of our future concerns about our interference in nitrogen’s biospheric cycle will not depend only on the eventual demand and our success in more effcient utilization of the nutrient. The fact that scientifc attention to the excess nitrogen in the biosphere grew considerably during the 1990s is not a reliable indicator of eventual public recognition.73 And even if it were so, how long would that last? Societies shift their worries: after all, concerns about nitrates in water helped to launch the Western environmental awareness of the late 1960s and the early 1970s, but they soon yielded to other worries.74 Acid rain caused by SO2 emissions gained prominence during the 1970s, the 1980s brought worries about the loss of stratospheric ozone, and the 1990s were dominated by concerns about the potentially destabilizing effects of rapid climate change.75 So far, concerns about fertilizer-induced alterations of nitrogen cycling have not ranked anywhere near the attention paid to these three environmental changes, and particularly to the possible risks of rapid global warming. Yet they too constitute an unprecedented large-scale experiment whose eventual impacts we cannot predict.

Contrary to popular wisdom, the proper first response to a changing world is not to ask, “How should we change?” but rather to ask, “What do we stand for and why do we exist?” This should never change. And then feel free to change everything else. Put another way, visionary companies distinguish their timeless core values and enduring purpose (which should never change) from their operating practices and business strategies (which should be changing constantly in response to a changing world).

Imagine you met a remarkable person who could look at the sun or stars at any time of day or night and state the exact time and date: “It’s April 23, 1401, 2:36 A.M., and 12 seconds.” This person would be an amazing time teller, and we’d probably revere that person for the ability to tell time. But wouldn’t that person be even more amazing if, instead of telling the time, he or she built a clock that could tell the time forever, even after he or she was dead and gone?3 Having a great idea or being a charismatic visionary leader is “time telling”; building a company that can prosper far beyond the presence of any single leader and through multiple product life cycles is “clock building.”

But [our first Wal-Mart store] was totally an outgrowth of everything we’d been doing since [1945]—another case of me being unable to leave well enough alone, another experiment.

In other words, we found that the visionary companies were much less likely to begin life with a “great idea” than the comparison companies in our study. Furthermore, whatever the initial founding concept, we found that the visionary companies were less likely to have early entrepreneurial success than the comparison companies. In only three of eighteen pairs did the visionary company have greater initial success than the comparison company, whereas in ten cases, the comparison company had greater initial success than the visionary company.

Thus, early in our project, we had to reject the great idea or brilliant strategy explanation of corporate success and consider a new view. We had to put on a different lens and look at the world backward. We had to shift from seeing the company as a vehicle for the products to seeing the products as a vehicle for the company. We had to embrace the crucial difference between time telling and clock building.

Bill Hewlett displayed a clock-building perspective in an internal speech: Our engineering staff [has] remained fairly stable. This was by design rather than by accident. Engineers are creative people, so before we hired an engineer we made sure he would be operating in a stable and secure climate. We also made sure that each of our engineers had a long range opportunity with the company and suitable projects on which to work. Another thing, we made certain that we had adequate supervision so that our engineers would be happy and would be productive to the maximum extent.... [The process of] engineering is one of our most important products [emphasis added].... we are going to put on the best engineering program you have ever seen. If you think we have done well so far, just wait until two or three years from now when we get all of our new lab people producing and all of the supervisors rolling. You’ll see some real progress then!34 Dave Packard echoed the clock-building orientation in a 1964 speech: “The problem is, how do you develop an environment in which individuals can be creative? ... I believe that you have to put a good deal of thought to your organizational structure in order to provide this environment.”35 In 1973, an interviewer asked Packard what specific product decisions he considered the most important in the company’s growth. Packard’s response didn’t include one single product decision. He answered entirely in terms of organizational decisions: developing an engineering team, a pay-as-you-go policy to impose fiscal discipline, a profit-sharing program, personnel and management policies, the “HP Way” philosophy of management, and so on. In a fitting twist, the interviewer titled the article, “Hewlett Packard Chairman Built Company by Design, Calculator by Chance.”36

After a short preliminary welcome, Packard began his talk: I want to discuss why [emphasis his] a company exists in the first place. In other words, why are we here? I think many people assume, wrongly, that a company exists simply to make money. While this is an important result of a company’s existence, we have to go deeper and find the real reasons for our being. As we investigate this, we inevitably come to the conclusion that a group of people get together and exist as an institution that we call a company so they are able to accomplish something collectively that they could not accomplish separately—they make a contribution to society, a phrase which sounds trite but is fundamental.... You can look around [in the general business world] and still see people who are interested in money and nothing else, but the underlying drives come largely from a desire to do something else—to make a product—to give a service—generally to do something which is of value. So with that in mind, let us discuss why the Hewlett-Packard Company exists.... The real reason for our existence is that we provide something which is unique [that makes a contribution].

What does it do to help these people find common cause with each other? ... And how can it sustain this common cause and sense of direction through the many changes which take place from one generation to another? ... [I think the answer lies] in the power of what we call beliefs and the appeal these beliefs have for its people.... I firmly believe that any organization, in order to survive and achieve success, must have a sound set of beliefs on which it premises all its policies and actions. Next, I believe that the most important single factor in corporate success is faithful adherence to those beliefs.... Beliefs must always come before policies, practices, and goals. The latter must always be altered if they are seen to violate fundamental beliefs. [emphasis ours]

In examining the history of the visionary companies, we were struck by how often they made some of their best moves not by detailed strategic planning, but rather by experimentation, trial and error, opportunism, and—quite literally—accident. What looks in hindsight like a brilliant strategy was often the residual result of opportunistic experimentation and “purposeful accidents.”

Johnson & Johnson’s Accidental Move into Consumer Products In 1890, Johnson & Johnson—then primarily a supplier of antiseptic gauze and medical plasters—received a letter from a physician who complained about patient skin irritation from certain medicated plasters. Fred Kilmer, the company’s director of research, quickly responded by sending a packet of soothing Italian talc to apply on the skin. He then convinced the company to include a small can of talc as part of the standard package with certain products. To the company’s surprise, customers soon began asking to buy more of the talc directly. J&J responded by creating a separate product called “Johnson’s Toilet and Baby Powder,” which became a famous household staple around much of the world. According to J&J’s own official history, “the Johnsons got into the baby powder business quite by accident.”4 Even more significant, the company thereby took a tiny incremental step that eventually mushroomed into a significant strategic shift into consumer products—an “accident” which eventually grew to become 44 percent of J&J’s revenues—and as important to its growth as medical supplies and pharmaceutical products.5 Later, J&J stumbled upon another famous product by accident. In 1920, company employee Earle Dickson created a ready-to-use bandage—made of surgical tape with small pieces of gauze and a special covering so it would not stick to the skin—for his wife who had a knack for cutting herself with kitchen knives. When he mentioned his invention to the marketing people, they decided to experiment with the product on the market. Eventually, after a slow start and a never-ending process of tinkering, Band-Aid products became the biggest selling category in the company’s history and further solidified J&J’s “accidental” strategic move into consumer products.

Similarly, Wal-Mart’s phenomenal success in the 1970s and 1980s can better be understood by an evolutionary perspective than a creationist perspective. In fact, the folks at Wal-Mart have always been somewhat amused by the primary explanation of Wal-Mart’s success frequently taught in microeconomics textbooks and MBA strategic planning courses. As Jim Walton summed up: We all snickered at some writers who viewed Dad [Sam Walton] as a grand strategist who intuitively developed complex plans and implemented them with precision. Dad thrived on change, and no decision was ever sacred.25 Indeed, the tools taught in most corporate strategy courses utterly fail to capture how the company’s strategic competitive advantage came to be—how Wal-Mart attained its “brilliant” system in the first place. The Wal-Mart system came into being not primarily by a strategic plan formulated by economic genius, but largely by an evolutionary process of variation and selection: “Multiply, vary, let the strongest [experiments] win, and the weakest die.”26 That’s exactly what Wal-Mart made a habit of doing from the time Sam Walton opened his first store in 1945. Wal-Mart looks like it had brilliant foresight, just as it looks like a species was preplanned and created. As a Wal-Mart executive described: “We live by the motto, ‘Do it. Fix it. Try it.’ If you try something and it works, you keep it. If it doesn’t work, you fix it or try something else.”27 Wal-Mart’s famous people greeters, for example, did not come from any grand plan or strategy. A store manager in Crowley, Louisiana, was having trouble with shoplifting, so he tried an experiment: He put a friendly older gentleman by the front door to “greet” people on their way in and out. The “people greeter” made honest people feel welcome: “Hi! How are ya? Glad you’re here. If there’s anything I can tell you about our store, just let me know.” At the same time, the greeter sent a message to potential shoplifters that someone would see them if they tried to walk out with stolen merchandise. No one at Wal-Mart—including Sam Walton—had conceived of anything like the greeter concept before the Crowley manager put it in place. Nonetheless, this odd experiment proved effective and eventually became standard practice across the company and a competitive advantage for Wal-Mart.

Instead of directing a business according to a detailed . . . strategic plan, Welch believed in setting only a few clear, overarching goals. Then, on an ad hoc basis, his people were free to seize any opportunities they saw to further those goals. . . . [Planful opportunism] crystallized in his mind . . . after he read Johannes von Moltke, a nineteenth century Prussian general influenced by the renowned military theorist Karl von Clausewitz [who] argued that detailed plans usually fail, because circumstances inevitably change.

Interestingly, however, 3M did not select innovations based strictly on market size. With mottoes like “Make a little, sell a little” and “Take small steps,”44 3M understood that big things often evolve from little things; but since you can’t tell ahead of time which little things will turn into big things, you have to try lots of little things, keep the ones that work and discard the ones that don’t. Operating “on a simple principle that no market, no end product is so small as to be scorned,”

TO have a Welch-caliber CEO is impressive. To have a century of Welch-caliber CEOs all grown from inside—well, that is one key reason why GE is a visionary company. In fact, the entire selection process that resulted in Welch becoming CEO was traditional GE at its best. Welch is as much a reflection of GE’s heritage as he is a change agent for GE’s future.

Indeed, Welch comes from a long heritage of managerial excellence atop GE. Using pretax return on equity (ROE) as a basic benchmark of financial performance, GE under Welch’s predecessors performed as well on average since 1915 as GE during Welch’s first decade in office—26.29 percent for Welch and 28.29 percent for his predecessors.12 In fact, when we ranked GE chief executive eras by return, the Welch era came in fifth place out of seven. (Every single GE chief executive, including Welch, outperformed rival Westinghouse in ROE during their tenure.) Of course, a straight ROE calculation doesn’t take into account the ups and downs of industry cycles, wars, depressions, and the like. So we also rank-ordered GE chief executive eras in terms of average annual cumulative stock returns relative to the market and Westinghouse.13 On this basis, we found Welch in second and fifth* place, respectively, relative to his predecessors. An excellent performance, but not the best in GE history. (See Table A.9 in Appendix 3.) This is no way detracts from Welch’s immense achievements. He ranks as one of the most effective chief executive officers in American business history. But—and this is the crucial point—so do his predecessors. Welch changed GE. So did his predecessors. Welch outperformed his counterparts at Westinghouse. So did his predecessors. Welch became widely admired by his peers—a “management guru” of his age. So did his predecessors. Welch laid the groundwork for the future prosperity of GE. So did his predecessors. We respect Welch for his remarkable track record. But we respect GE even more for its remarkable track record of continuity in top management excellence over the course of a hundred years. TO have a Welch-caliber CEO is impressive. To have a century of Welch-caliber CEOs all grown from inside—well, that is one key reason why GE is a visionary company. In fact, the entire selection process that resulted in Welch becoming CEO was traditional GE at its best. Welch is as much a reflection of GE’s heritage as he is a change agent for GE’s future.

To reinforce the concept of leadership continuity from within, Bob Galvin discarded the traditional concept of a chief executive officer in favor of the concept of a Chief Executive Office occupied by “team members.” “Members” plural is not a misprint. Galvin envisioned an office held by multiple team members (usually three) at any one time, rather than a single leader. Galvin did this in part to ensure that the company would have capable insiders well positioned to assume leadership responsibility at any point in time.

As Bill Hewlett said about his long-time friend and business partner David Packard upon Packard’s death in 1996, “As far as the company is concerned, the greatest thing he left behind him was a code of ethics known as the HP Way.1 HP’s core ideology, which has guided the company since its inception in 1938, includes a deep respect for the individual as a moral tenet, a dedication to affordable quality and reliability, a commitment to community responsibility (Packard bequeathed his $4.3 billion of HP stock to a charitable foundation), and a view that the company exists to make technical contributions for the advancement and welfare of humanity.

At the founding of the company, Masaru Ibuka described two key elements of Sony’s ideology: “We shall welcome technical difficulties and focus on highly sophisticated technical products that have great usefulness for society regardless of the quantity involved; we shall place our main emphasis on ability, performance, and personal character so that each individual can show the best in ability and skill.” Four decades later, this same ideology appeared in the “Sony Pioneer Spirit”: “Sony is a pioneer and never intends to follow others. Through progress, Sony wants to serve the whole world. It shall be always a seeker of the unknown. . . . Sony has a principle of respecting and encouraging one’s ability. . . and always tries to bring out the best in a person. This is the vital force of Sony.”3 Same core values; different words.

Yet for all their derivativeness and for all the concessions that Walt made to Winkler, subjugating his creative instincts to hers, the Alice comedies did express a fundamental vision of Walt Disney. Unlike Out of the Inkwell, where Koko cavorts in a photographic reality that is obdurate and unyielding, in the Alices a real girl enters a fantasy of her own devising—a pliable world that, whatever the girl’s misadventures there, always finally conforms to her desires and Julius’s machinations and in which chaos ultimately yields to control. And in creating this situation, Walt was also creating through his cartoons a metaphor of liberation and power. If the Fleischers suggested the implacability of the physical world, Walt suggested the malleability of one’s own psychological world into which one could escape as Alice does.

It was the prospect of sound now that motivated the staff—the prospect of doing something no one had done. They finished animating the second Mickey, The Gallopin’ Gaucho, a silent that was already in production when Walt hatched his plan, then eagerly moved on to the third cartoon—the sound cartoon. Just as Walt had spoofed Lindbergh in Plane Crazy and swashbuckler Douglas Fairbanks in The Gaucho, he decided to spoof comedian Buster Keaton’s Steamboat Bill, Jr. for Steamboat Willie. Eager to test the proposition of sound, once again the staff worked quickly. Iwerks said that they resolved the story in a single night, and within weeks he had animated a musical test sequence of Mickey/Willie at the steamboat’s wheel, tooting the pipes and whistling. Eager to see whether sound would augment the cartoon as he had anticipated, Walt had the scene inked, painted, and filmed even before the rest of the animation was completed, then recruited Jackson, who was the only member of the staff with any musical talent, to play “Turkey in the Straw,” one of Jackson’s favorite tunes, and “Steamboat Bill,” Walt’s choice, on the harmonica. One night, probably in late June, at about eight o’clock, Walt had a projector set up in the yard behind the studio bungalow so that the whirring of the machine would not contend with the accompaniment.* The image was thrown through a window and onto a bedsheet hung in a large room off of Walt’s office where the backgrounds were drawn. He stationed Jackson with his harmonica, animator Johnny Cannon, who could make sound effects with his mouth, and several other staff members behind his office door, which had a window in it that allowed them to see the back of the bedsheet. When Roy started the projector, Jackson played his music, Cannon made his sounds, and the others banged pencils against spittoons that served as gongs—all synchronized to Mickey’s actions. They performed repeatedly so that each of the participants could witness the effect for himself. And with an appreciation for the magnitude of the event—the fate of the studio rested on the outcome—they had an audience. Walt had invited Lillian, Edna, Iwerks’s wife Mildred, Hazel Sewell, and Jackson’s girlfriend, later wife, Jane Ames, to watch what he hoped would be a historic occasion. “I never saw such a reaction in an audience in my life,” the usually taciturn Iwerks would recall, citing encore after encore. “The scheme worked perfectly.

But while Walt was recording the Mickeys and soaking up praise, he had another, bigger mission in New York—a personal mission. During his first New York trip, when he was pushing Mickey and facing rejection, one distributor picked up a package of Life Saver candies. “The public knows Life Savers,” he told Walt. “They don’t know you. They don’t know your mouse.” That made an impression on Walt. As he recalled it years later, he said to himself, “From now on they’re going to know, if they liked the picture—they’re going to know what his [the producer’s] name is.” So on this trip he had decided to stage a full-scale assault on the animation industry and establish “Walt Disney” as its undisputed leader—the Life Savers of animation.

Excellence was not only Walt’s business strategy, it was the reason he ran the studio and the force that kept his personal world intact. “If you want to know the real secret of Walt’s success,” longtime animator Ward Kimball would say, “it’s that he never tried to make money. He was always trying to make something that he could have fun with or be proud of.”

Yet for all the obvious appeal of Moore’s pigs, another element contributed just as mightily to the cartoon’s success. During one storyboarding session Walt had perused the continuity and suggested that a little song should be inserted. Frank Churchill, who was now the studio composer, immediately began pounding out a tune on the piano. Ted Sears provided a couplet, and when he ran out of lyrics, Pinto Colvig, the storyman and voice artist, improvised a whistle to complete the musical line. Later two freelance singers were hired for a one-day recording session at ten dollars apiece, and “Who’s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?” began its march on musical history.

“We were part of a thing that was maybe going to last.” There was very little griping and virtually no competition among the employees, only camaraderie. Work was joy. “It wasn’t that you had to do these things,” Marc Davis said. “You wanted to do them. You were so proud. Every write-up the studio got, everybody went out and got it. Very few people have ever, as a group, experienced that type of excitement.”

Clements and Musker froze, their dismay evident. Finally Eisner said, “Part of your job is to talk me out of bad ideas.”

“Creativity is a funny thing,” Roy continues. “It’s a living, breathing force with a life of its own and it tends to flower among individuals and in small groups.” Disney must “resume our trajectory of creativity and financial success” by “trusting the talents and imaginations of its creative people—and I can’t emphasize enough the word trust—and then by supporting them with the resources they require.

He was also the first person I ever worked for who embraced technological advancements to revolutionize what we did and how we did it. Reverse-angle cameras, slow-motion replays, airing events live via satellite—that’s all Roone. He wanted to try every new gadget and break every stale format. He was looking, always, for new ways to connect to viewers and grab their attention. Roone taught me the dictum that has guided me in every job I’ve held since: Innovate or die, and there’s no innovation if you operate out of fear of the new or untested.

No detail was too small for Roone. Perfection was the result of getting all the little things right. On countless occasions, just as I’d witnessed at the Sinatra concert, he would rip up an entire program before it aired and demand the team rework the whole thing, even if it meant working till dawn in an editing room. He wasn’t a yeller, but he was tough and exacting and he communicated in very clear terms what was wrong and that he expected it to get fixed, and he didn’t much care what sacrifice it required to fix it. The show was the thing. It was everything to him. The show was more important to Roone than to the people who made it, and you had to make peace with that if you worked for him. His commitment to making things great was galvanizing. It was often exhausting, often frustrating (largely because he would wait until very late in the production process to give notes or demand changes), but it was inspiring, too, and the inspiration far outweighed the frustration.

His mantra was simple: “Do what you need to do to make it better.” Of all the things I learned from Roone, this is what shaped me the most. When I talk about this particular quality of leadership, I refer to it as “the relentless pursuit of perfection.” In practice that means a lot of things, and it’s hard to define. It’s a mindset, really, more than a specific set of rules. It’s not, at least as I have internalized it, about perfectionism at all costs (something Roone wasn’t especially concerned about). Instead, it’s about creating an environment in which you refuse to accept mediocrity. You instinctively push back against the urge to say There’s not enough time, or I don’t have the energy, or This requires a difficult conversation I don’t want to have, or any of the many other ways we can convince ourselves that “good enough” is good enough.

You can do a lot for the morale of the people around you (and therefore the people around them) just by taking the guesswork out of their day-to-day life. A CEO must provide the company and its senior team with a road map. A lot of work is complex and requires intense amounts of focus and energy, but this kind of messaging is fairly simple: This is where we want to be. This is how we’re going to get there. Once those things are laid out simply, so many decisions become easier to make, and the overall anxiety of an entire organization is lowered.

KURT BARNARD, RETAILING CONSULTANT: "I was executive vice president of the discounters' trade association, working in my New York office one day in 1967. My secretary said there was a man out front who wanted to join our group. I said I would give him ten minutes. So in comes this short, wiry man with a deep tan and a tennis racket under his arm. He introduced himself as Sam Walton from Arkansas. I didn't know what to think. When he meets you, he looks at you—head cocked to one side, forehead slightly creased—and he proceeds to extract every piece of information in your possession. He always makes little notes. And he pushes on and on. After two and a half hours, he left, and I was totally drained. I wasn't sure what I had just met, but I was sure we would hear more from him."

It was always interesting to me that, except for those folks who worked in our company, our stock got very little support early on from the folks right here in northwest Arkansas. I always had the feeling that the people around here who remembered us when we had one store and three stores, or remembered me when I was president of the Rotary or the Chamber of Commerce, somehow thought we were doing it with mirrors. They couldn't help but think we were just lucky, that we could not continue long term to do as well as we have done. I don't think it was anything peculiar to this part of the country or me or anything like that. I think it must be human nature that when somebody homegrown gets on to something, the folks around them sometimes are the last to recognize it.

The decision we reached around that time, to commit ourselves to giving the associates more equitable treatment in the company, was without a doubt the single smartest move we ever made at Wal-Mart. In 1971, we took our first big step: we corrected my big error of the year before, and started a profit-sharing plan for all the associates. I guess it's the move we made that I'm proudest of, for a number of reasons. Profit sharing has pretty much been the carrot that's kept Wal-Mart headed forward. Every associate of the company who has been with us at least a year, and who works at least 1,000 hours a year, is eligible for it. Using a formula based on profit growth, we contribute a percentage of every eligible associate's wages to his or her plan, which the associate can take when they leave the company—either in cash or Wal-Mart stock. There's nothing that unusual about the structure of the plan. It's the performance I'm so proud of. For the last ten years, the company contributed an average of 6 percent of wages to the plan. Last year, for example, Wal-Mart's contribution was $125 million. Now, the folks who administer profit sharing—and this includes a committee of associates—have chosen year after year to keep the plan invested mostly in Wal-Mart stock, so the thing has grown beyond belief, collectively, and in the individual accounts of a lot of associates. Today, as I write this, profit sharing has around $1.8 billion in it—equity in the company that belongs to our associate partners.

For us, thinking small is a way of life, almost an obsession. And I suspect thinking small is an approach that almost any business could profit from. The bigger you are, the more urgently you probably need it. At our size today, there's all sorts of pressure to regiment and standardize and operate as a centrally driven chain, where everything is decided on high and passed down to the stores. In a system like that, there's absolutely no room for creativity, no place for the maverick merchant that I was in the early days at Ben Franklin, no call for the entrepreneur or the promoter. Man, I'd hate to work at a place like that, and I worry every single day about Wal-Mart becoming that way. I stay on these guys around here all the time about it.

My boat crew at times had struggled to perform, until I figured out that I had to put myself in the most difficult position at the front of the boat and lead. That required driving the boat crew members hard, harder than they thought they could go. I discovered that it was far more effective to focus their efforts not on the days to come or the far-distant finish line they couldn’t yet see, but instead on a physical goal immediately in front of them—the beach marker, landmark, or road sign a hundred yards ahead. If we could execute with a monumental effort just to reach an immediate goal that everyone could see, we could then continue to the next visually attainable goal and then the next. When pieced together, it meant our performance over time increased substantially and eventually we crossed the finish line at the head of the pack.

A true leader is not intimidated when others step up and take charge. Leaders that lack confidence in themselves fear being outshined by someone else. If the team is successful, then recognition will come for those in charge, but a leader should not seek that recognition.

It was not until Bernoulli’s study of fluid mechanics helped him articulate the mechanism through which airfoils create lift that human flight began to be possible. But understanding the mechanism itself still wasn’t enough to make the ability to fly perfectly predictable. Further research, entailing careful experimentation and measurement under various conditions, was needed to identify the circumstances in which that mechanism did and did not yield the desired result. When the mechanism did not result in successful flight, researchers had to carefully decipher why—what it was about the circumstances in which the unexpected result occurred that led to failure. Once categories could be stated in terms of the different types of circumstances in which aviators might find themselves, then aviators could predict the conditions in which flight was and was not possible. They could develop technologies and techniques for successfully flying in those circumstances where flight was viable. And they could teach aviators how to recognize when the circumstances were changing, so that they could change their methods appropriately. Understanding the mechanism (what causes what, and why) made flight possible; understanding the categories of circumstances made flight predictable.20

The Innovator’s Dilemma identified two distinct categories—sustaining and disruptive—based on the circumstances of innovation. In sustaining circumstances—when the race entails making better products that can be sold for more money to attractive customers—we found that incumbents almost always prevail. In disruptive circumstances—when the challenge is to commercialize a simpler, more convenient product that sells for less money and appeals to a new or unattractive customer set—the entrants are likely to beat the incumbents.

Few technologies or business ideas are intrinsically sustaining or disruptive in character. Rather, their disruptive impact must be molded into strategy as managers shape the idea into a plan and then implement it. Successful new-growth builders know—either intuitively or explicitly—that disruptive strategies greatly increase the odds of competitive success.

The third critical element of the model is the distinction between sustaining and disruptive innovation. A sustaining innovation targets demanding, high-end customers with better performance than what was previously available. Some sustaining innovations are the incremental year-by-year improvements that all good companies grind out. Other sustaining innovations are breakthrough, leapfrog-beyond-the-competition products. It doesn’t matter how technologically difficult the innovation is, however: The established competitors almost always win the battles of sustaining technology. Because this strategy entails making a better product that they can sell for higher profit margins to their best customers, the established competitors have powerful motivations to fight sustaining battles. And they have the resources to win. Disruptive innovations, in contrast, don’t attempt to bring better products to established customers in existing markets. Rather, they disrupt and redefine that trajectory by introducing products and services that are not as good as currently available products. But disruptive technologies offer other benefits—typically, they are simpler, more convenient, and less expensive products that appeal to new or less-demanding customers.

Once the disruptive product gains a foothold in new or low-end markets, the improvement cycle begins. And because the pace of technological progress outstrips customers’ abilities to use it, the previously not-good-enough technology eventually improves enough to intersect with the needs of more demanding customers. When that happens, the disruptors are on a path that will ultimately crush the incumbents. This distinction is important for innovators seeking to create new-growth businesses. Whereas the current leaders of the industry almost always triumph in battles of sustaining innovation, successful disruptions have been launched most often by entrant companies.

This is not a history of bungled steel company management. It is a story of rational managers facing the innovator’s dilemma: Should we invest to protect the least profitable end of our business, so that we can retain our least loyal, most price-sensitive customers? Or should we invest to strengthen our position in the most profitable tiers of our business, with customers who reward us with premium prices for better products? The executives who confront this dilemma come in all varieties: timid, feisty, analytical, and action-driven. In an unstructured world their actions might be unpredictable. But as large industry incumbents, they encounter powerful and predictable forces that motivate them to flee rather than fight when attacked from below. That is why shaping a business idea into a disruption is an effective strategy for beating an established competitor. Disruption works because it is much easier to beat competitors when they are motivated to flee rather than fight.

Disruption Is a Relative Term An idea that is disruptive to one business may be sustaining to another. Given the stark odds that favor the incumbents in the sustaining race but entrants in disruptive ones, we recommend a strict rule: If your idea for a product or business appears disruptive to some established companies but might represent a sustaining improvement for others, then you should go back to the drawing board. You need to define an opportunity that is disruptive relative to all the established players in the targeted market, or you should not invest in the idea. If it is a sustaining innovation relative to the business model of a significant incumbent, you are picking a fight you are very unlikely to win.

Moving up the trajectory into successively higher-margin tiers of the market and shedding less-profitable products at the low end is something that all good managers must do in order to keep their margins strong and their stock price healthy. Standing still is not an option, because firms that stop moving up find themselves in a rebaresque situation, slugging it out with hard-to-differentiate products against competitors whose costs are comparable.12 This ultimately means that in doing what they must do, every company prepares the way for its own disruption. This is the innovator’s dilemma. But it also is the beginning of the innovator’s solution.

Because the established company’s course of action is mandated so clearly, it is also clear what executives who seek to create new-growth businesses should do: Target products and markets that the established companies are motivated to ignore or run away from.

Our original dimensions—time and performance—define a particular market application in which customers purchase and use a product or service. In geometric terms, this application and set of customers reside in a plane of competition and consumption, which The Innovator’s Dilemma called a value network. A value network is the context within which a firm establishes a cost structure and operating processes and works with suppliers and channel partners in order to respond profitably to the common needs of a class of customers. Within a value network, each firm’s competitive strategy, and particularly its cost structure and its choices of markets and customers to serve, determines its perceptions of the economic value of an innovation. These perceptions, in turn, shape the rewards and threats that firms expect to experience through disruptive versus sustaining innovations.14 FIGURE 2 - 3 The Third Dimension of the Disruptive Innovation Model

Although new-market disruptions initially compete against non-consumption in their unique value network, as their performance improves they ultimately become good enough to pull customers out of the original value network into the new one, starting with the least-demanding tier. The disruptive innovation doesn’t invade the mainstream market; rather, it pulls customers out of the mainstream value network into the new one because these customers find it more convenient to use the new product.

Executives must answer three sets of questions to determine whether an idea has disruptive potential. The first set explores whether the idea can become a new-market disruption. For this to happen, at least one and generally both of two questions must be answered affirmatively: Is there a large population of people who historically have not had the money, equipment, or skill to do this thing for themselves, and as a result have gone without it altogether or have needed to pay someone with more expertise to do it for them? To use the product or service, do customers need to go to an inconvenient, centralized location? If the technology can be developed so that a large population of less skilled or less affluent people can begin owning and using, in a more convenient context, something that historically was available only to more skilled or more affluent people in a centralized, inconvenient location, then there is potential for shaping the idea into a new-market disruption. The second set of questions explores the potential for a low-end disruption. This is possible if these two questions can be answered affirmatively: Are there customers at the low end of the market who would be happy to purchase a product with less (but good enough) performance if they could get it at a lower price? Can we create a business model that enables us to earn attractive profits at the discount prices required to win the business of these overserved customers at the low end? Often, the innovations that enable low-end disruption are improvements that reduce overhead costs, enabling a company to earn attractive returns on lower gross margins, coupled with improvements in manufacturing or business processes that turn assets faster. Once an innovation passes the new-market or low-end test, there is still a third critical question, or litmus test, to answer affirmatively: Is the innovation disruptive to all of the significant incumbent firms in the industry? If it appears to be sustaining to one or more significant players in the industry, then the odds will be stacked in that firm’s favor, and the entrant is unlikely to win. If an idea fails the litmus tests, then it cannot be shaped into a disruption. It may have promise as a sustaining technology, but in that case we would expect that it could not constitute the basis of a new-growth business for an entrant company. For summary, table 2-1 summarizes and contrasts the characteristics of the three strategies that firms might pursue in creating new-growth businesses: sustaining innovations, low-end disruptions, and new-market disruptions. It compares the targeted product performance or features, the targeted customers or markets, and the business model implications that each route entails. We hope that managers can use this as a template so that they can categorize and see the implications of different plans that might be presented to them for approval. TABLE 2 - 1     Three Approaches to Creating New-Growth Businesses     Dimension     Sustaining Innovations     Low-End Disruptions     New-Market Disruptions   Targeted performance of the product or service     Performance improvement in attributes most valued by the industry’s most demanding customers. These improvements may be incremental or breakthrough in character.     Performance that is good enough along the traditional metrics of perform- ance at the low end of the mainstream market.     Lower performance in“traditional” attributes, but improved performance in new attributes— typically simplicity and convenience.     Targeted customers or market application     The most attractive (i.e., profitable) customers in the mainstream markets who are willing to pay for improved performance.     Overserved customers in the low end of the mainstream market.     Targets non- consumption: customers who historically lacked the money or skill to buy and use the product.     Impact on the required business model (processes and cost structure)     Improves or maintains profit margins by exploiting the existing processes and cost structure and making better use of current competitive advantages.     Utilizes a new operating or financial operating or financial different combination of lower gross profit margins and higher asset utilization that can earn attractive returns at the discount prices required to win business at the low end of the market.     Business model must make money at lower price per unit sold, and at unit production volumes that initially will be small. Gross margin dollars per unit sold will be signifi cantly lower.

We believe that this approach, based on the notion that customers “hire” products to do specific “jobs,” can help managers segment their markets to mirror the way their customers experience life. In so doing, this approach can also uncover opportunities for disruptive innovation.

Marketers often segment markets by product type, by price point, or by the demographics and psychographics of the individuals or companies who are their customers. With all the effort expended on segmentation, why do the innovation strategies based on these categorization or segmentation schemes fail so frequently? The reason, in our view, is that these delineations are defined by the attributes of products and customers. As we see over and over in this book, theories based on attribute-based categorizations can reveal correlations between attributes and outcomes. But it is only when marketing theory offers a plausible statement of causality and is built upon circumstance-based categorization (segmentation) schemes that managers can confidently assert what features, functions, and positioning will cause customers to buy a product.

Predictable marketing requires an understanding of the circumstances in which customers buy or use things. Specifically, customers—people and companies—have “jobs” that arise regularly and need to get done. When customers become aware of a job that they need to get done in their lives, they look around for a product or service that they can “hire” to get the job done. This is how customers experience life. Their thought processes originate with an awareness of needing to get something done, and then they set out to hire something or someone to do the job as effectively, conveniently, and inexpensively as possible.

In other words, the jobs that customers are trying to get done or the outcomes that they are trying to achieve constitute a circumstance-based categorization of markets.3 Companies that target their products at the circumstances in which customers find themselves, rather than at the customers themselves, are those that can launch predictably successful products. Put another way, the critical unit of analysis is the circumstance and not the customer.

The first time that builders of a new-growth business need to assess what the target customers really are trying to get done is when they are searching for the disruptive foothold—the initial product or service that is the point of entry for a new-market disruption. When managers position a disruptive product squarely on a job that has been poorly addressed in the past that a lot of people are trying to get done, they create a launch pad for subsequent growth through sustaining innovations that build on the initial platform.

If RIM evolved the BlackBerry to help people be ever more productive in small snippets of time, if Palm evolved its Pilot to help people be ever better organized, and if J-Phone’s handsets were optimized to help teenagers have fun, the products would become quite differentiated in consumers’ minds—and each could grow to own a large market share of its respective job.

Unfortunately, it appears that many manufacturers in this space are now on a collision course. Each seems bent on packing every other competitor’s functionality into a single, all-purpose device. Unchecked, this will lead to commoditized, undifferentiated products that don’t do really well any of the jobs that they once got hired to do. This need not be so. The suicidal trajectory results from framing the market in terms of the attributes of products and the attributes of customers, rather than in terms of jobs to be done.

There are at least four reasons or countervailing forces in established companies that cause managers to target innovations at attribute-based market segments that are not aligned with the way that customers live their lives. The first two reasons—the fear of focus and the demand for crisp quantification—reside in companies’ resource allocation processes. The third reason is that the structure of many retail channels is attribute focused, and the fourth is that advertising economics influence companies to target products at customers rather than circumstances.

The odds of developing successful new products begin to tumble when managers collectively begin to assume that the customer’s world is structured in the same way that the data are aggregated. When managers define market segments along the lines for which data are available rather than the jobs that customers need to get done, it becomes impossible to predict whether a product idea will connect with an important customer job. Using these data to define market segments causes managers to aim innovation at phantom targets. When they frame the customer’s world in terms of products, innovators start racing against competitors by proliferating features, functions, and flavors of products that mean little to customers.16 Framing markets in terms of customer demographics, they average across several different jobs that arise in customers’ lives and develop one-size-fits-all products that rarely leave most customers fully satisfied. And framing markets in terms of an organization’s boundaries further restricts innovators’ abilities to develop products that will truly help their customers get the job done perfectly.

The answer is that just as it needs to develop products for the circumstance and not the customer, the chain needs to communicate to the circumstance, and not necessarily to the consumer. It can communicate to the circumstance with a brand, if it employs the right branding strategy. If it does this, then when customers find themselves in the circumstance, they will think instinctively of the brand and know what product to buy in order to get that job done.

Marriott Corporation has done the same thing by developing a brand architecture that is consistent with several different jobs its customers experience in life. This architecture has facilitated the creation of new disruptive businesses, while strengthening the Marriott brand at the same time. Under the endorsement of the Marriott brand, we have been taught to hire a Marriott Hotel when the job is to convene a major business meeting, and to choose a Courtyard by Marriott (“The hotel designed by business travelers for business travelers”) when the job is to get a clean, quiet place to work into the evening. We learned to hire Fairfield Inn by Marriott when the job is finding an inexpensive place to stay as a family, and Residence Inn by Marriott to find a home away from home. The Marriott brand remains unsullied by all of this, because the purpose brands make the job clear.

Another example: Hundreds of millions have been spent to apply new technologies—the Internet and e-book displays, specifically—to reshape the college textbook industry. Innovators have attempted to develop and sell tablets that can display downloaded e-books. And with many textbooks, you can click on a URL to obtain far more information about the topic than could possibly be included within the limits of a book. Would we expect these investments to generate significant growth? Our guess is that they will not. Although we would like to believe that all undergraduate students are rigorous seekers of knowledge, the job that many college students are really trying to get done, from our observation, is to pass their courses without having to read the textbook at all. These companies have spent a lot of money helping students to do more easily something that they have been trying not to do. It would probably take far less money to create from the same technology a service called “Cram.com”—a utility that would make it easier and cheaper for students to cram more effectively for their exams. This would likely work because cramming is something that students already are trying to do, but with marginal efficacy. There are a lot of textbook-avoiders on campuses—a huge market of nonconsumption. After logging on, Cram.com would ask subscribers what course they need to cram for—say, College Algebra. Then it would ask which of this list of textbooks the professor expected them to have read by now. It would ask them to click on the type of problem that they are having trouble with, and it would walk them through a tutorial.

Competing with Interdependent Architecture in a Not-Good-Enough World The left side of figure 5-1 indicates that when there is a performance gap—when product functionality and reliability are not yet good enough to address the needs of customers in a given tier of the market—companies must compete by making the best possible products. In the race to do this, firms that build their products around proprietary, interdependent architectures enjoy an important competitive advantage against competitors whose product architectures are modular, because the standardization inherent in modularity takes too many degrees of design freedom away from engineers, and they cannot optimize performance.

When firms must compete by making the best possible products, they cannot simply assemble standardized components, because from an engineering point of view, standardization of interfaces (meaning fewer degrees of design freedom) would force them to back away from the frontier of what is technologically possible. When the product is not good enough, backing off from the best that can be done means that you’ll fall behind.

Customers are happy to accept improved products, but they’re unwilling to pay a premium price to get them.7 Overshooting does not mean that customers will no longer pay for improvements. It just means that the type of improvement for which they will pay a premium price will change. Once their requirements for functionality and reliability have been met, customers begin to redefine what is not good enough. What becomes not good enough is that customers can’t get exactly what they want exactly when they need it, as conveniently as possible. Customers become willing to pay premium prices for improved performance along this new trajectory of innovation in speed, convenience, and customization. When this happens, we say that the basis of competition in a tier of the market has changed.

Modularity has a profound impact on industry structure because it enables independent, nonintegrated organizations to sell, buy, and assemble components and subsystems.8 Whereas in the interdependent world you had to make all of the key elements of the system in order to make any of them, in a modular world you can prosper by outsourcing or by supplying just one element.

What drives this process is this predictable causal sequence: The pace of technological improvement outstrips the ability of customers to utilize it, so that a product’s functionality and reliability that were not good enough at one point overshoot what customers can utilize at a later point. This forces companies to compete differently: The basis of competition changes. As customers become less and less willing to reward further improvements in functionality and reliability with premium prices, those suppliers that get better and better at conveniently giving customers exactly what they want when they need it are able to earn attractive margins. As competitive pressures force companies to be as fast and responsive as possible, they solve this problem by evolving the architecture of their products from being proprietary and interdependent toward being modular. Modularity enables the dis-integration of the industry. A population of nonintegrated firms can now outcompete the integrated firms that had dominated the industry. Whereas integration at one point was a competitive necessity, it later becomes a competitive disadvantage.13

To succeed with a nonintegrated, specialist strategy, you need to be certain you’re competing in a modular world. Three conditions must be met in order for a firm to procure something from a supplier or partner, or to sell it to a customer. First, both suppliers and customers need to know what to specify—which attributes of the component are crucial to the operation of the product system, and which are not. Second, they must be able to measure those attributes so that they can verify that the specifications have been met. Third, there cannot be any poorly understood or unpredictable interdependencies across the customer–supplier interface.

There are few decisions in building and sustaining a new-growth business that scream more loudly for sound, circumstance-based theory than those addressed in this chapter. When the functionality and reliability of a product are not good enough to meet customers’ needs, then the companies that will enjoy significant competitive advantage are those whose product architectures are proprietary and that are integrated across the performance-limiting interfaces in the value chain. When functionality and reliability become more than adequate, so that speed and responsiveness are the dimensions of competition that are not now good enough, then the opposite is true. A population of nonintegrated, specialized companies whose rules of interaction are defined by modular architectures and industry standards holds the upper hand.

5.   Many readers have equated in their minds the terms disruptive and breakthrough. It is extremely important, for purposes of prediction and understanding, not to confuse the terms. Almost invariably, what prior writers have termed “breakthrough” technologies have, in our parlance, a sustaining impact on the trajectory of technological progress. Some sustaining innovations are simple, incremental year-to-year improvements. Other sustaining innovations are dramatic, breakthrough leapfrogs ahead of the competition, up the sustaining trajectory. For predictive purposes, however, the distinction between incremental and breakthrough technologies rarely matters. Because both types have a sustaining impact, the established firms typically triumph. Disruptive innovations usually do not entail technological breakthroughs. Rather, they package available technologies in a disruptive business model. New breakthrough technologies that emerge from research labs are almost always sustaining in character, and almost always entail unpredictable interdependencies with other subsystems in the product. Hence, there are two powerful reasons why the established firms have a strong advantage in commercializing these technologies.

13.  The evolving structure of the lending industry offers a clear example of these forces at work. Integrated banks such as J.P. Morgan Chase have powerful competitive advantages in the most complex tiers of the lending market. Integration is key to their ability to knit together huge, complex financing packages for sophisticated and demanding global customers. Decisions about whether and how much to lend cannot be made according to fixed formulas and measures; they can only be made through the intuition of experienced lending officers.             Credit scoring technology and asset securitization, however, are disrupting and dis-integrating the simpler tiers of the lending market. In these tiers, lenders know and can measure precisely those attributes that determine whether borrowers will repay a loan. Verifiable information about borrowers—such as how long they have lived where they live, how long they have worked where they work, what their income is, and whether they’ve paid other bills on time—is combined to make algorithm-based lending decisions. Credit scoring took root in the 1960s in the simplest tier of the lending market, in department stores’ decisions to issue their own credit cards. Then, unfortunately for the big banks, the disruptive horde moved inexorably up-market in pursuit of profit—first to general consumer credit card loans, then to automobile loans and mortgage loans, and now to small business loans. The lending industry in these simpler tiers of the market has largely dis-integrated. Specialist nonbank companies have emerged to provide each slice of added value in these tiers of the lending industry. Whereas integration is a big advantage in the most complex tiers of the market, in overserved tiers it is a disadvantage.

16.  Specifiability, measurability, and predictability constitute what an economist would term “sufficient information” for an efficient market to emerge at an interface, allowing organizations to deal with each other at arm’s length. A fundamental tenet of capitalism is that the invisible hand of market competition is superior to that of managerial oversight as a coordinating mechanism between actors in a market. This is why, when a modular interface becomes defined, an industry will dis-integrate at that interface. However, when specifiability, measurability, and predictability do not exist, efficient markets cannot function. It is under these circumstances that managerial oversight and coordination perform better than market competition as a coordinating mechanism.

When the relevant dimensions of your product’s performance are determined not by you but by the subsystems that you procure from your suppliers, it becomes difficult to earn anything more than subsistence returns in a product category that used to make a lot of money. When your world becomes modular, you’ll need to look elsewhere in the value chain to make any serious money. The natural and inescapable process of commoditization occurs in six steps: As a new market coalesces, a company develops a proprietary product that, while not good enough, comes closer to satisfying customers’ needs than any of its competitors. It does this through a proprietary architecture, and earns attractive profit margins. As the company strives to keep ahead of its direct competitors, it eventually overshoots the functionality and reliability that customers in lower tiers of the market can utilize. This precipitates a change in the basis of competition in those tiers, which . . . . . . precipitates an evolution toward modular architectures, which . . . . . . facilitates the dis-integration of the industry, which in turn . . . . . . makes it very difficult to differentiate the performance or costs of the product versus those of competitors, who have access to the same components and assemble according to the same standards. This condition begins at the bottom of the market, where functional overshoot occurs first, and then moves up inexorably to affect the higher tiers. Note that it is overshooting—the more-than-good-enough circumstance—that connects disruption and the phenomenon of commoditization.

A company that finds itself in a more-than-good-enough circumstance simply can’t win: Either disruption will steal its markets, or commoditization will steal its profits. Most incumbents eventually end up the victim of both, because, although the pace of commoditization varies by industry, it is inevitable, and nimble new entrants rarely miss an opportunity to exploit a disruptive foothold.

This is especially true for the BlackBerry, because its “always on” capability mandates extraordinarily efficient use of power. Because of this, the BlackBerry engineers cannot incorporate a one-size-fits-all Intel microprocessor into their device. It has far more capability than is needed. Rather, they need a modular microprocessor design—a system-on-a-chip that is custom-configured for the BlackBerry—so that they do not have to waste space, power, or cost on functionality that is not needed. The microprocessor must be modular and conformable in order to permit engineers to optimize the performance of what is not good enough, which is the device itself. Note that this is the opposite situation from that of a desktop computer, where it is the microprocessor that is not good enough. The architecture of the computer must therefore be modular and conformable in order to allow engineers to optimize the performance of the microprocessor. Thus, one side or the other must be modular and conformable to allow for optimization of what is not good enough through an interdependent architecture.

We noted previously that when the functionality and reliability of a product become more than good enough, the basis of competition changes. What becomes not good enough are speed to market and the rapid and responsive ability to configure products to the specific needs of customers in ever-more-targeted market segments. The customer interface is the place in the value chain where the ability to excel on this new dimension of competition is determined. Hence, companies that are integrated in a proprietary way across the interface to the customer can compete on these not-good-enough dimensions more effectively (and be rewarded with better margins) than can those firms that interface with their customers only in an arm’s-length, “modular” manner. Companies that integrate across the retail interface to the customer, in this circumstance, can also earn above-average profits.

1.   There are two ways to think of a product or service’s value chain. It can be conceptualized in terms of its processes, that is, the value-added steps required to create or deliver it. For example, the processes of design, component manufacture, assembly, marketing, sales, and distribution are generic processes in a value chain. A value chain can also be thought of in terms of components, or the “bill of materials” that go into a product. For example, the engine block, chassis, braking systems, and electronic subassemblies that go into a car are components of a car’s value chain. It is helpful to keep both ways of thinking about a value chain in mind, since value chains are also “fractal”—that is, they are equally complex at every level of analysis. Specifically, for a given product that goes through the processes that define its value chain, various components must be used. Yet every component that is used has its own sequence of processes through which it must pass. The complexity of analyzing a product’s value chain is essentially irreducible. The question is which level of complexity one wishes to focus on.

A surprising number of innovations fail not because of some fatal technological flaw or because the market isn’t ready. They fail because responsibility to build these businesses is given to managers or organizations whose capabilities aren’t up to the task. Corporate executives make this mistake because most often the very skills that propel an organization to succeed in sustaining circumstances systematically bungle the best ideas for disruptive growth.

Resources are the most tangible of the three factors in the RPV framework. Resources include people, equipment, technology, product designs, brands, information, cash, and relationships with suppliers, distributors, and customers. Resources are usually people or things—they can be hired and fired, bought and sold, depreciated or built. Most resources are visible and often are measurable, so managers can readily assess their value. They tend to be quite flexible as well: It is relatively easy to transport them across the boundaries of organizations.

But when the same, seemingly efficient process is employed to tackle a very different task, it often seems bureaucratic and inefficient.

Rather, they are the enabling or back-ground processes that support investment decisions. These include how market research is habitually done, how such analysis is translated into financial projections, how plans and budgets are negotiated and how those numbers are delivered, and so on.

One of the bittersweet rewards of success is, in fact, that as companies become large, they literally lose the capability to enter small emerging markets.

Success is easier to sustain when the locus of the capability to innovate successfully migrates from resources to processes and values. It actually begins to matter less which people get assigned to which project teams. In large, successful management consulting firms, for example, hundreds of new MBA’s join the firm every year, and almost as many leave. But they are able to crank out high-quality work year after year because their capabilities are rooted in their processes and values rather than in their resources.

As a new company’s processes and values are coalescing, the actions and attitudes of the company’s founder typically have a profound impact. The founder often has strong opinions about the way employees ought to work together to reach decisions and get things done. Founders similarly impose their views of what the organization’s priorities need to be. If the founder’s methods are flawed, of course, the company will likely fail. But if those methods are useful, employees will collectively experience for themselves the validity of the founder’s problem-solving methodologies and criteria for decision making. As they successfully use those methods of working together to address recurrent tasks, processes become defined. Likewise, if the company becomes financially successful by prioritizing various uses of its resources according to criteria that reflect the founder’s priorities, the company’s values begin to coalesce. As successful companies mature, employees gradually come to assume that the priorities they have learned to accept, and the ways of doing things and methods of making decisions that they have employed so successfully, are the right way to work. Once members of the organization begin to adopt ways of working and criteria for making decisions by assumption, rather than by conscious decision, then those processes and values come to constitute the organization’s culture.

In using figure 7-1, it is important to remember that disruption is a relative term. What is disruptive to one company might have a sustaining impact on another. For example, Dell Computer began by selling computers over the telephone. For Dell, the initiative to begin selling over the Internet was a sustaining innovation. It helped Dell make more money in the way it was already structured to make money. Not surprisingly Dell adopted Internet retailing very successfully. For Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, and IBM, however, marketing directly to customers was decidedly disruptive because of its impact on their retail channel partners. They couldn’t make room for Internet distribution within their existing organizations, and so their attempts to incorporate this new channel were far less successful. The only way they could have succeeded at becoming leaders in marketing computers directly to customers was to have done it within an autonomous business unit, and possibly with a new brand.

The result? Within a year, the values of the mainstream business had forced Woolco’s margins up to 34 percent, and Woolco’s inventory turns declined to four times—both mirroring the profit model of the F. W. Woolworth stores. Woolco ultimately had to be closed. Very quickly, just as we saw with Merrill Lynch’s implementation of Internet brokerage, the business model of the potentially disruptive business simply had to conform itself to the processes and values of the organization in which it was housed. As a general law of organizational nature, there is no other possible outcome. Organizations cannot disrupt themselves. Managers can only do what makes sense to them, given the context in which they work. As a disruptive opportunity, Woolco needed to remain separate.

Managers whose organizations are confronting opportunities to grow must first determine that they have the people and other resources required to succeed. They then need to ask two further questions: Are the processes by which work habitually gets done in the organization appropriate for this new project? And will the values of the organization give this initiative the priority it needs? Established companies can improve their odds for success in disruptive innovation if they use functionally oriented and heavyweight teams where each is appropriate, and if they commercialize sustaining innovations in mainstream organizations but put disruptive ones in autonomous organizations. A primary reason successful innovation seems difficult and unpredictable is that firms often employ talented people whose management skills were honed to address stable companies’ problems. And often, managers are set to work within processes and values that weren’t designed for the new task. Instead of accepting onesize-fits-all policies, if executives will spend time ensuring that capable people work in organizations with processes and values that match the task, they will create a major point of leverage in successfully creating new growth.

Actual strategy is manifest only through the stream of new products, processes, services, and acquisitions to which resources are allocated. The resource allocation process is typically complex and diffused, operating at every level and all the time. If the values that guide prioritization decisions in resource allocation are not carefully tied to the company’s deliberate strategy (and often they are not), then significant disparities can develop between a company’s deliberate strategy and its actual strategy. Actively monitoring, understanding, and controlling the criteria by which day-to-day resource allocation decisions are made at all levels of the organization are among the highest-impact challenges a manager can tackle in the strategy development process.

Research suggests that in over 90 percent of all successful new businesses, historically, the strategy that the founders had deliberately decided to pursue was not the strategy that ultimately led to the business’s success.12 Entrepreneurs rarely get their strategies exactly right the first time. The successful ones make it because they have money left over to try again after they learn that their initial strategy was flawed, whereas the failed ones typically have spent their resources implementing a deliberate strategy before its viability could be known.

In most waves of disruptive growth, a host of competitors are drawn to the opportunity. Firms that do not emerge from the pack as leaders fail in one of two places. First, many of the initial entrants fail because they spend their money aggressively implementing a deliberate strategy in the nascent stages when the right strategy cannot be known. The second point of failure occurs after the market and its applications become clear to the firms that have managed the emergent strategy process most effectively. The firms that then get left in the dust are those whose executives do not seize deliberate control of resource allocation and focus all investments in executing the race up-market.

Strategy-Making Process The resource allocation process is the filter through which all strategic actions must flow. Because it is so complex and diffused throughout a company, it is rare that senior executives can simply devise a new strategy and “implement” it. Rather, defining and implementing strategy entails managing the conditions under which the strategy and resource allocation processes operate so that the strategy process can work efficiently, given the circumstances that each of the company’s organizations is in. Effective, appropriate processes will generate the needed strategic insights. The remainder of this chapter focuses on three points of executive leverage on the strategy process. Managers must: Carefully control the initial cost structure of a new-growth business, because this quickly will determine the values that will drive the critical resource allocation decisions in that business. Actively accelerate the process by which a viable strategy emerges by ensuring that business plans are designed to test and confirm critical assumptions using tools such as discovery-driven planning. Personally and repeatedly intervene, business by business, exercising judgment about whether the circumstance is such that the business needs to follow an emergent or deliberate strategy-making process. CEOs must not leave the choice about strategy process to policy, habit, or culture.

Discovery-driven planning is a way to actively manage the emergent strategy process. As depicted in table 8-1, it involves reordering the four steps. The first step is to make the financial projections—the targeted or required financial performance of the venture. The logic behind this is quite compelling. If everybody knows how good the numbers must look in order to win funding, why go through the cyclical charade of making and revising assumptions in order to make the numbers look good enough? The required income statement and return on investment should just be the standard first slide in every presentation. The second step, where the real work begins, is to compile an assumptions checklist. It answers the question, “We all know how good the numbers need to be. So what assumptions need to prove true in order for us to realistically expect that these numbers will materialize?” The assumptions on this list should be rank-ordered from most to least crucial. The list must include assumptions related to each of the theories in this book: that low-end or new-market disruptions are possible, that the targeted customers will use the new product for the jobs they are trying to get done, that the new venture will lead the company to the point in the value chain where the money will be in the future, and so on. TABLE 8 - 1     A Discovery-Driven Method for Managing the Emergent Strategy Process     Sustaining Innovations: Deliberate Planning     Disruptive Innovations: Discovery-Driven Planning   (Note: decisions to initiate these projects can be grounded on numbers and rules.)     (Note: decisions to initiate these projects should be based on pattern recognition.)     1. Make assumptions about the future.     1. Make the targeted financial projections.     2. Define a strategy based on those assumptions, and build financial projections based on that strategy.     2. What assumptions must prove true in order for these projections to materialize?     3. Make decisions to invest based on those financial projections.     3. Implement a plan to learn—to test whether the critical assumptions are reasonable.     4. Implement the strategy in order to achieve the projected financial results.     4. Invest to implement the strategy.   The third and fourth steps in discovery-driven planning also reverse the order of the deliberate strategy process. The third step is to implement a plan. This is not a deliberate strategic plan, but rather a plan to test the validity of the most important assumptions. This plan needs to generate quickly, and with as little expense as possible, validating or invalidating information about the most critical assumptions. This enables innovators to revise the strategy prior to the fourth step—the decision to implement through significant investment. This can be done after the viability of various assumptions becomes more evident. Innovators who are using the discovery-driven process frequently learn quite early that there just isn’t a reasonable set of assumptions to support a plan that will achieve the numbers the organization requires. This might imply that the idea simply can’t be shaped into a viable strategy at all. Or it might mean that the idea needs to be placed within a smaller business unit, whose values might not demand that it get prohibitively big prohibitively fast.

Executives cannot twist an on/off valve to start and stop the flow of opportunities and problems from deliberate and emergent directions. These are always flowing in, and the CEO’s job is to manage constantly which direction should predominantly influence strategic thinking. The valve, which is the resource allocation process, can get really sticky—which is why CEOs need to keep their hands on the control constantly and consciously. When a viable strategy has emerged and it is time for execution, the CEO needs aggressively to switch to a deliberate strategy mode and stop funding emergent opportunities that might divert the company from its focus on the winning plan. Once this has been done, however, executives often suffer amnesia and selectively remember only their success in deliberately implementing the successful strategy. They lose memory of the emergent process through which the successful strategy was discovered, and therefore forget to reset the strategy process to an emergent mode in those new organizations that are attempting to build the next growth businesses. Nearly all companies, as a result, employ one-size-fits-all deliberate strategy systems. This is a very common reason why new ventures launched by corporations and by many venture capital firms fail.21

Strategic initiatives enter the resource allocation process from two sources—deliberate and emergent. In circumstances of sustaining innovation and certain low-end disruptions, the competitive landscape is clear enough that strategy can be deliberately conceived and implemented. In the nascent stages of a new-market disruption, however, it is almost impossible to get the details of strategy right. Rather than executing a strategy, managers in this circumstance need to implement a process through which a viable strategy can emerge. There are three points of executive leverage in strategy making. The first is to manage the cost structure, or values of the organization, so that orders of disruptive products from ideal customers can be prioritized. The second is discovery-driven planning—a disciplined process that accelerates learning what will and won’t work. The third is to vigilantly ensure that deliberate and emergent strategy processes are being followed in the appropriate circumstances for each business in the corporation. This is a challenge that few executives have mastered, and is one of the most important contributors to innovative failure in established companies.

The type of money that corporate executives provide to new-growth businesses and the type of capital that managers of those businesses accept represent fundamental early choices when launching a new-growth business. These are critical fork-in-the-road decisions, because the type and amount of money that managers accept define the investor expectations that they’ll have to meet. Those expectations then heavily influence the types of markets and channels that the venture can and cannot target.

We have concluded that the best money during the nascent years of a business is patient for growth but impatient for profit.

We’ve already demonstrated why the money that funds a new-growth business needs to be patient for growth. Competing against nonconsumption and moving disruptively up-market are critical elements of a successful new-growth strategy—and yet by definition, these disruptive markets are going to be small for a time. The only way that a venture can instantly become big is for existing users of a high-volume product to be enticed to switch en masse to the new enterprise’s product. This is the province of sustaining innovation, and start-ups rarely can win a sustaining-innovation battle. Money should be impatient for growth in later-stage, deliberate-strategy circumstances, after a winning strategy for the new business has emerged.

Expectations of early profit also help a venture’s managers to keep fixed costs low. A business model that can make money at low costs per unit is a crucial strategic asset in both new-market and low-end disruptive strategies, because the cost structure determines the type of customers that are and are not attractive. The lower it can start, the greater its upside.

It is when growth slows—when senior executives see that the sustaining-innovation pipeline is inadequate to meet investor expectations—that investing to grow becomes hard. The character of the firm’s money changes when new things must get very big very fast, and it won’t allow innovators to do what is needed to grow. When you’re a corporate entrepreneur and you sense this shift in the corporate context occurring, you had better watch out. This dilemma traps nearly every company and is the causal mechanism behind the findings in Stall Points, the Corporate Strategy Board’s study that we cited in chapter 1.

and to create new products and businesses. Financial results measure how healthy the business was, not how healthy the business is.9 Financial results are a particularly bad tool to manage disruption, because moving up-market feels good financially, as we have noted previously.

Christensen asked for a student vote at the beginning of class: “After reading the paper, how many of you think that the leading MBA programs are being disrupted?” Three of the 102 students raised their hands. The other 99 took the position that these developments weren’t relevant to the venerable institutions’ fortunes. Christensen then asked one of the three who was worried to explain why. “There’s a real pattern here,” he responded, and he listed six elements of the pattern. These included MBA salaries overshooting what operating companies can afford; the disruptors competing against nonconsumption; people hiring on-the-job education to get a very different job done; a shift in the basis of competition to speed, convenience, and customization; and interdependent versus modular curricula. He concluded that the pattern fit: All of the things that had happened to other companies as they were disrupted were indeed under way in management education. “That’s why I’d take this seriously,” he concluded.

The end of the teaching case pictures Lankton puzzling about this outcome. Why was it that he had seen so clearly the growing demand for rapid delivery of a widening variety of short-run precision parts, and yet his plants hadn’t been able to land any of that business for their Novaplast machines? Was it a victory or a failure that Novaplast’s ultimate success came from a very high-volume, standard, high-precision part? The answer is that this is exactly the result we would expect from the processes and values that supported the existing business model. Nypro’s finely honed innovation engine shaped Novaplast as a sustaining technology, because this is exactly what the system was designed to do—to shape every investment to help the company make money in the way it was structured to make money. An organization cannot disrupt itself. It can only implement technologies in ways that sustain its profit or business model. The consequence for Nypro of allowing the standard process to remain in control is that (so far) the company has missed the chance to create a major new disruptive growth business. To succeed at this disruption, Lankton would have needed to create a sales organization whose compensation structure energized salespeople to pursue this high-variety, low-volume-per-part business. He would have needed to build an operating organization whose processes were tuned to this work and to create measures of performance that were different from those that drove success in the core business. None of the processes of the core business could make these judgment calls correctly. This is why the CEO needs to stand astride the interface between mainstream business units and new disruptive growth businesses.8

A company that embeds the ability to do this in a process would own a valuable growth engine. Such an engine would have four critical components, as depicted in figure 10-1. First, it needs to operate rhythmically and by policy, rather than in response to financial developments. This would ensure that new businesses get launched while the corporation is still growing robustly, and that new businesses would not be pressured to grow too big too fast. Second, the CEO or another senior executive who has the confidence and the authority to lead from the top when necessary must lead the effort. This is particularly important in the early years, when success still depends more on resources than on processes. Third, it would establish a small corporate-level group—movers and shapers—whose members develop a practiced, repeatable system for shaping ideas into disruptive business plans that are funded and launched. Fourth, it would include a system for training and retraining people throughout the organization to identify disruptive opportunities and to take them to the movers and shapers.

Never say yes to a strategy that targets customers and markets that look attractive to an established competitor. Keep sending the team back to the drawing board until they’ve identified a disruptive foothold that established competitors will be happy to ignore or be relieved to walk away from. If you create asymmetries of motivation, your competitors will help you win. Though you may not have done this before, it should feel good if you are accustomed to bloody fights of sustaining innovation against motivated competitors.

If your team targets customers who already are using pretty good products, send them back to see if they can find a way to compete against nonconsumption. When your customers are delighted to have a simple, inexpensive product because their alternative is to have nothing, all the techniques for pleasing customers that you learned in Marketing 101 will be easy and inexpensive. This also should spell welcome relief compared with the alternative, which is the massive investment typically required to make disruptive technologies preferable to the established products that customers already are comfortable using.

If there are no nonconsumers available, ask your team to explore whether a low-end disruption is feasible. They must devise a business model that can make attractive profits at the discount prices required to capture customers at the low end of the market, who can’t use all the functionality for which they currently must pay. If this isn’t possible either, then don’t invest—or at least, don’t invest with the expectation that this will create a significant growth business.

If the project leader ever uses the phrase, “If we can just get the customer to . . . ,” terminate the conversation. Send the team back to find a way to help customers get done more conveniently and inexpensively what they already are trying to get done. Competing wishfully against customers’ manifest priorities has shortened the tenure-in-job of some pretty good people.

If the team’s product or marketing plan focuses on market segments whose boundaries mirror your organization’s boundaries, or if the targeted market is segmented along the lines for which data are readily available (by product type, price point, or demographic category), send the team back. Ask them to segment the market in ways that mirror the jobs that customers are trying to get done. Remind the team that you still have no alternative but to hire a one-size-fits-all milkshake for at least two different jobs that arise regularly in your life. The milkshake business is stalled because quick-service restaurants keep improving the shake’s attributes rather than doing each job better and better—which would grow the category by helping shakes to steal share from the real competition.

If your team’s product improvement road map assumes that the basis of competition won’t change—that the types of improvements that merited good margins in the past will continue to merit those margins in the future—look at the low end. Often you can see there the opportunity to change the basis of competition.

If your disruptive product or service is not yet good enough and your team seems enthralled with industry standards and the attendant outsourcing and partnering deals, raise a big red flag. If you prematurely pursue modularity and open standards, or if you keep a proprietary architecture closed while the basis of competition changes, you’ll struggle to succeed. Remember what made Wayne Gretzky so good. It is better to develop competencies where the money will be made in the future than to cling tenaciously to those skills that made you successful in the past.

If your team assures you that you’ll succeed because a new venture fits your company’s core competence, tell them that you can’t deal in fuzzy concepts. Ask for answers to three specific questions: • Do we have the resources to succeed? • Will our processes—the ways we have learned to work together to succeed in our established businesses—facilitate what needs to be done to succeed in the new business? • Will our values, or the criteria that folks here use to prioritize one thing over another, enable the critical people to give the needed priority to this initiative when compared with the other initiatives that compete for their time, money, and talent?

Ask these three questions about each of the entities that constitute the venture’s channels as well. It’s not just you. The channel companies’ processes and values—their methods and motivations—can cause your venture to come off the rails or even stall before leaving the station.

Unfortunately, you may need to distrust the managers whom you have learned to trust. The managers in your organization who have most consistently delivered results in the past may be the least skilled at delivering success in new-growth businesses. In choosing the management team for your new venture, don’t look at the attributes that describe the people you might tap to lead a new-growth venture, or at the magnitude of their past responsibilities. Search their résumés for the problems they have grappled with, and compare them to the problems that you know this venture must confront.

Be sure that in the beginning years after a venture is launched, the development team remains convinced that they aren’t sure what the best strategy is, in terms of products, customers, and applications. Insist that the team give you a plan to accelerate the emergence of a viable strategy. Call a halt to decisive plans to implement any strategy before there is evidence that it works.

Be impatient for profit. When someone tells you as a senior executive that you must endure years of substantial losses before a new business will become huge and profitable, this flags a plan to cram a disruptive technology into a sustaining role in an established market. Some investments in sustaining technologies with extensive interdependencies across the value chain can indeed require years of massive investment. Let established competitors tackle those. In disruptive circumstances, patiently enduring years of losses generally allows a team to pursue the wrong strategy for a long time.

Keep your company growing so that you can be patient for growth. Disruption—and competing against nonconsumption in particular—requires a longer runway before a steep ascent is possible. If corporate growth slows and you then force the new businesses to attempt too fast a takeoff, you will force the management to make other fatal mistakes. The other side to this mandate is important as well. If you’re slated to lead a new venture and corporate management says you need to become very big very fast, what you really are hearing is that management is going to make you cram your disruptive technology into an established market. When you sense this, don’t take the job. You are very likely to fail.
